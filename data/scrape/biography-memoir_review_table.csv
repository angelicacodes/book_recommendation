My plan is to listen to the audiobook with hopes that Matthew McConaughey narrates it himself so I can get wrapped up in that warm, friendly, country-boy voice of his as if he is talking directly to me.

I will update this review after October 20, 2020.
Edit Oct 20: Reading now... review coming."

Alright alright alright...5 easy breezy stars. It felt like I sat around with him over a glass of scotch and he told me stories of his life. He‚Äôs witty, funny, smooth, and worked his literary skills through my heart. I laughed out loud, I paused to write down deep truths that resonated with me, and I face palmed at some of his antics.

Indeed it is. McConaughey is a guy who really pursued his dreams. (view spoiler)

He added his signature voice, animation, and laughs and made this book absolutely perfect. Its a memoir and personal reflection and humor and even a bit philosophical. I looked forward to listening. He owned his mistakes (and laughed at himself at times) and was not negative, he was always looking for ways to grow and improve himself. I have nothing but respect for him and this will be one of my Top 5 books of 2020. I Highly Recomm"

I'm not gonna lie, I really enjoyed this one. I didn't expect to, I was skeptical to say the least, but I ended up loving the heck out of the audiobook narrated by Matthew himself.

This one is quite a treat. Full of insightful little thoughts and proclamations, quirky stories (that are almost unbelievable, tho completely and amazingly believable because they did happen), anecdotes, humor.. It was just so pleasant a book to listen to. A great insight into Matthew's past,"

I will finish it by this evening but have already heard enough to say this is the best autobiography I have ever listened to. McConaughey narrates his book and the performance is outstanding to say the least.

I was on the fence at first about even giving it a listen, thinking it probably won't be my cup of tea. The first 10 minutes or so, I was beginning to think just that. Then it all changed and I was hooked. It's ver"

McConaughey was a C student in college, claiming he was normally an A student but wanted to devote time to real world instead of books, and at the end of this books says he'd rather ""take an experienced C over an ignorant A any day."" Well, this book is a C at best and could have been an A if he would have been less self-satisfied and allowed others to guide him to objective conclusions.

This book was fun, it was entertaining, it was interesting. It made me laugh so much and it broke my heart. Matthew has been one of my favourite actors since A Time To Kill. I loved hearing his behind the scenes stories about making his movies.

So you best believe I pre-ordered this book immediately.

Matthew McConaughey has been keeping journals, diaries, and random writings for the past 35 years. Greenlights is all of those writings in one perfect little book. We get to hear about his childhood, his rise to fame, his Hollywood hiatus, his wife and kids, and so much more.

I have to say, the first 25% of the book was not the spark I was looking expecting from Matthew McConaughey."

I've read books about the mind, successes and all that stuff.

This book has some things about success. It's called Greenlights after all. But this book is about the boat shaken, the frequency, and the story of a man who connected to his own natural frequency. It's raw, honest and most of all it's damn funny!

That's a book I want to have on my table and read throughout life."

The stories were memorable and entertaining, and McConaughey uses these to inform his brand of folk philosophy. I found some of his framing of ideas to be quite novel.

McConaughey writes like he‚Äôs telling us these stories by a campfire. It's just shy of 300 pages and I really could've spent a hundred more reading McConaughey's stories.

Greenlights was uplifting, interesting, and the only thing (other than the election updates) that could hold my attention fully during this stressful week.

McConaughey is one of those actors, twinkly-eyed, easy-going, almost effortlessly buff and charming and likeable. And guess what? You'll probably think the same of him after listening to this audiobook of his life (or reading a paper version).

He is a born raconteur, and by far the best parts of this book are the epic stories. He is also given to hippy-dippy mysticism, self-help sloganeering, and a towering sense of self-regard.

The McConaissance, a term coined by a journalist, is what gravitated me toward Mr. McConaughey. This is the time in his career as an actor that he turned on its head. He was typecast as the chiseled, beach-bod jock bankable in every rom-com role. But he desired something more, something deeper. A calling from within drove at his heart like something out of a Poe story. He was determined to lose that typecasting and finally dip his toes in the murky waters of dramatic acting.

Invite some gangster to take retribution against me by kneecapping my baby and then laugh when he realizes it‚Äôs physically impossible? That was no good to me; I would have needed to lay the gr"

I'm giving all 6 essays in this collection the same rating since it *is* a collection. Mindy is a fantastic writer but I mostly found this collection ""meh"". Perhaps it's because there were only 6 so I felt dissatisfied--I don't know. I just didn't feel as connected to her as I did in her previous books. I'd still recommend the collection--it's a fast and light read, and Mindy's writing voice is extremely personable."

I‚Äôm happy Mindy used her celebrity status for good: opening up about her journey into motherhood and showing that it‚Äôs okay not to be okay. I don‚Äôt yet have children of my own but hope to some day, and I can only imagine the constant fear of whether what you‚Äôre doing is right, perfect or ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù I‚Äôm glad Mindy found her own normal."
Fatima,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7089995-fatima,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55056141-help-is-on-the-way,"My favourite one so far out of the collection. I have three more to go!

This was such a sweet, heartwarming essay on her first pregnancy & the relationship she built with her daughter‚Äôs nurse, Rose. We also gain some touching insight on Mindy‚Äôs relationship with her mother & her fears about motherhood and the apprehension of asking for help.

I will read anything & everything Mindy has to write! Definite 5 stars for this one. Also - that knee quote made me LOL."
Rochelle,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103561793-rochelle,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55056141-help-is-on-the-way,"""Don't complain, don't explain""; it's a quote Mindy's mother lived by.

In this part of the series she talks about her decision to hire a baby nurse and how that plays out for her. It's emotional, comedic, humane. What I liked about this part is that she has humanized a 'celebrity mom'.
She compares how motherhood was for her mother vis-a-vis herself.

She is single, has lost her mother and is somewhat terrified about motherhood. She finds her way eventually. Kudos to her!"

I love Mindy's conversational style and clean writing. This is a wonderful, emotional fast read that touches on a very difficult thing for many people...asking for and accepting help. Mindy shares her thoughts and emotions so openly that it reads like an email or text from a friend rather than a story you downloaded and read first thing before getting out of bed on a Saturday."

This essay, like the others released in this collection, has made me laugh and cry. Mindy Kaling has long been my idol, and her honesty and voice are comforting.

Mindy‚Äôs story about life postpartum without her mom really resonated with me. Like everything she writes, it is hilarious and brilliantly written.

In this book she has shared an incident in which she hasn't shyed away from criticising herself. She's aware of the difference between generosity and giving.
She recognises her past mistakes and has grown above them now. It's like a coming of age tale squeezed into an essay.

Mindy Kaling has such a real voice. She is able to talk about her life in a way that gives you a peek into the celebrity world as well as the real world foibles of a human being.

Kaling brings her trademark wit and humor to everyday life and how her life has changed since becoming a parent. She offers funny quips and touching insights in an engaging and enjoyable fashion."

Mindy Kaling relates her feelings about being single at couples parties and fantasizes about what they think of her. Her imagined perfect partner is Coach Taylor (as played by Kyle Chandler in the Friday Night Lights TV-series).

Searching for Coach Taylor is one of the six-part Nothing Like I Imagined collection of autobiographical short comedy essays by Mindy Kaling available through Amazon Originals."

Although I found comical her list of reasons why she doesn't regret being single, her bashing of married people and a husband in general was regrettable. She clearly does not understands the real bliss and commitment that come from fighting for and working on the covenant of marriage long term. Her whole view really is a commentary on how marriage is viewed and often handled by many young single adults today, as well those choosing to live together before marriage."

Another one of Mindy's quirky takes on what it is to be single, and a single mom being pitied by her married friends, the times she wish she had a husband and times she is happy not to have one.

Anyways, the drifter incident was bizarre and the Mindy-B.J. duo were hilarious, but the best part was how Mindy summed up her reaction to the drifter (and all of his weirdness) with a ""y tho?""."

I'm giving all 6 essays in this collection the same rating since it *is* a collection. Mindy is a fantastic writer but I mostly found this collection ""meh"". Perhaps it's because there were only 6 so I felt dissatisfied--I don't know. I just didn't feel as connected to her as I did in her previous books. I'd still recommend the collection--it's a fast and light read, and Mindy's writing voice is extremely personable."

Review of the Amazon Original kindle eBook (2020)

A story of a dinner outing with author Kaling and her bff B.J. a fellow writer. Not really on a level with the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood teaser hint of the title, but a fun story nevertheless.

Once Upon a Time in Silver Lake is one of the six-part Nothing Like I Imagined collection of autobiographical short comedy essays by Mindy Kaling available through Amazon Originals."

I don't understand why they don't just put all these essays into one collection. I wouldn't call this a book in a series because it's just like one extended monologue.

She's been more or less a part of the pop culture landscape since The Office, which is a long time, and her works are worth reading.

This...seemed out of place. Less an essay, more of an interesting podcast story in and of itself (ooh...how meta). The note about how Mindy never wants to listen to podcasts but wants to h"

My 5th short story read from Mindy on her super wierd yet super funny encounter with a homeless/drifter man and her friend,  B. J.. I can literally visualize how Mindy and B. J. from 'The Office' would have enacted such a scene.

The nice part about Mindy's writing is she shares simple stories about her life, ties it back to some lesson she learned or an observation about the larger truth of the world. This coupled with her writing makes it relatable and hence it works!"

The story also seemed pointless to me; except for her own condition at the time and her surprising, real bravado! That's a treat to look out for.

The other parts in this series are better than this one and have more substance.
It is mysterious though and like a scene from a movie, the events play out perfectly; much like fiction!"

Esperanza Navarro,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11798318-esperanza-navarro,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"3 1/2 to 4 stars. I love Lenny Kravitz. He‚Äôs my secret boyfriend but doesn‚Äôt know it. I listened to the audiobook and he narrated, which had quite the appeal, but he was very monotone and it made the story kind of boring. The book was decent enough, interesting, but I wanted more from it. It seems there will be a ‚Äúnext era‚Äù coming and I‚Äôll be interested in that. This was good but not as good as I had hoped."
Kristin,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58705371-kristin,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"This book, while well-written was very focused on his early childhood and family life. He ended the book around 1990 when his first album was released. If you are looking for a book about his rise to fame and celebrity, I would skip this one. The writing was very beautiful but ending the book when you're career is just taking off seems an odd choice. Maybe this means there will be a second book of his memoirs? Not sure..."
Joanne,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35970265-joanne,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"Although I‚Äôve never really spent much time listening to Lenny‚Äôs music, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to him read this book. He is very introspective and deep. His deep love for his extended family and strong creative genius comes through loud and clear. I decided to read (listen) to this book after hearing him interviewed on a podcast. His voice as narrator is mellifluous (don‚Äôt you love that word?!)"
Traci Jackson,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26460402-traci-jackson,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"This book is amazing. I need more musicians to do audiobooks. I absolutely loved hearing Lenny sing a few lines from songs he sang as a child to those he put on his album. I loved learning what made him who he is, what influenced his musical style and his fashion sense. I got it all and so much more in this book."
Shannon Yarbrough,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18421291-shannon-yarbrough,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,I listened to the audiobook which is ready by Lenny himself and made this so worth it. Lots of good memories in here of his mother and his relationship with his father. Most of the book covers his childhood and slow rise to fame with the release of his first album. His marriage to Lisa and their first child is also mentioned. A very nice memoir if you are a Lenny fan.
Laura Harris,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64282700-laura-harris,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"Love Lennys music and style this book isn‚Äôt going to change that. However felt it was heavy on the name dropping and famous connections and light on substance , emotion and depth of what makes him tick. Why such a conflict with his dad ? Found I lost interest here and there . Maybe he‚Äôll go deeper for the next 25 years of his life memoir."
Terri,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4613869-terri,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"I loved Lenny‚Äôs book. I listened to him read it, and he even sang some parts of it. He‚Äôs such a sweet soul. I thought his story was fascinating. Lenny worries about his hair and clothes a little too much, but hey, how can he be the king of cool without worrying about his hair and clothes? üòÇ I can‚Äôt wait for the follow up book."
Aggie,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2383930-aggie,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"Nice memoir by one of rocks most chill legends. Great stories of him growing up in New York with his mixed race parents and learning about life from his African-American family as well as his Jewish family, who lived in different neighborhoods in NYC. Lenny shares his philosophies and influences as well."
Lee Ann,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2446412-lee-ann,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"I saw this book on my library's New Biographies list and thought, ""I bet Lenny Kravitz has had an interesting life."" He has, and with David Ritz he does a good job recounting his story. My only complaint is that the book ends with ""Let Love Rule"" atop the charts, he and Lisa Bonet deeply in love, and the birth of their daughter, Zoe."
Audreygold,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3496565-audreygold,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,I felt shortchanged as this memoir only covers his first 25 years when he is young and lucky. He doesn't even address his divorce from Lisa Bonet. Audio is the way to go because Kravitz's voice is beautiful and he sings a little of his music -- wish it had been more. His reflecting on his teen years before cell phones and the internet calls attention to what a different world we are in today.
Star Girl,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15833226-star-girl,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"This was disappointing. It was simply written and focused mostly on his life prior to age 20. He only gets into his relationship with Lisa Bonet towards the end and then leaves it with a ""to be continued"" which means there will be another book that will actually focus on his success as a Rockstar and what happened for him and Lisa to separate. Ugh!!!"
Phyllis Schwindt,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55458051-phyllis-schwindt,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"Very well written. It is the story of the first 25 years or so of Lenny Kravitz. Love between him and his mother and the conflict between him and his father. Lenny was a creative kid but a terrible student. He found his peace in music. From Manhattan, Brooklyn, LA and the Bahama‚Äôs he made connections that help propel his career."
Dayva,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/993794-dayva,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"I was pretty disappointed in the writing. Nothing of Lenny Kravitz's personality showed through. I feel like he used his fellow writer to help tell a story that he, himself, would have been better at putting into words. This book just really felt shallow compared to the real word creativity of the man. It's very rare that I give this kind of review to an autobiography."
Rosie,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106243836-rosie,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"I was expecting more of his story. It ends with ""to be continued."" Interesting memoir that shows the struggle it takes to make it in the music industry, with family baggage in tow...the good, the bad and the ugly. Lenny did a great job narrating."

He has such a beautiful soul and heart. I really enjoyed learning about his family and all the special people he surrounded himself with. He is very candid and ever humble.
Daphne Moore Cooper,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/107861295-daphne-moore-cooper,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"As a major Lenny fan I couldn‚Äôt wait for this book, and I got both the audible and hard copy. I highly recommend the audible version though, you‚Äôll be treated to a mini concert. An amazing story and really hope he writes about his journey after Let Love Rule next."
Annie Oortman,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4473833-annie-oortman,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,This beautiful story by a beautiful individual enthralled me from the first word. Lenny reading his story made for a compelling read that I didn't want to end. His voice and emotional tone made me feel like I was living the history by his side. The song samples were icing on the top!
Lulu,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8427052-lulu,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"I've had a thing for Lenny Kravitz for quite a while and I enjoyed the hell out of this book. It only covers the time up until his daughter, Zoe, is born, so we are missing a good 30 plus years. And I normally hate that, but there is so much beauty in his story...I just can‚Äôt complain."
Wendy,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1061982-wendy,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"I love Lenny Kravitz and his music. It was interesting to hear of his dedication and love of music, but I found this book more about the telling of a super privileged life, although trying to describe hardship."
Alissa,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1255013-alissa,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,This was so good - I had to make myself put it down to go to bed last night! I am kicking myself for not listening to him reading the audio version because I can imagine that only made it even better! I can‚Äôt wait for the next book!! üòç
Eric,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26861902-eric,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"This biography was well-written, and portrays a really interesting life. It ends with the release of Let Love Rule (Lenny's first album), so I'm anxious to learn more about his subsequent life. I think Kravitz has a really interesting story to tell."
D'Arcy,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6466131-d-arcy,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"One of the more enjoyable autobiographies I've read. I just wish it had gone on for longer, as it ends just as Lenny starts to have success. Though I enjoyed reading about his unorthodox childhood. Overall, I would recommend if you're a fan."
Jodi,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42841-jodi,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"Let me save you a read: Lenny Kravitz does not like his dad, lives off the largesse of different women (mom, girlfriends, Lisa Bonet) while he tries to find his sound, and drops the names of all the famous people. Super annoying & kinda boring."
Sheri Johnson,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72837573-sheri-johnson,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"Finished it in two days and so sad when it was done.

Cheryl,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4059419-cheryl,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"I enjoyed the audio version, which was read by Lenny. I didn‚Äôt know much about his background except that he had been married to Lisa Bonet. This book covers the first part of his life up until he finally starts to make it big as a musician. It‚Äôs a short listen at 6+ hours."

It is interesting to hear him talk about troubles with his father, yet simultaneously see how his early exposure with music was cultivated by his father."
Preston,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55775224-preston,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"To Be Continued?

I really enjoyed this book a lot, I love Lenny Kravitz. BUT... and apologies if this is a spoiler in any way, maybe as the title says, it only covers up to him putting out Let Love Rule and then ends. It kind of reminded me of how‚Äôs Fleas autobiography read."
Ru,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/253021-ru,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,Highly recommend the audio version since Lenny reads it. It sounds like he was meant for stardom from an early age crossing paths with famous people. Family is important to him and it comes across in his writing. Definitely an interesting and enjoyable book. Did I mention he sings?
Holly,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109201969-holly,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51096899-let-love-rule,"This memoir is chock-full of information, and it moves along at a rapid clip so it‚Äôs never boring.

This one was disappointing. The premise sounded great - ""opt out"" of the expected paths and find your own way/adventures. She writes the book with ""opting out"" being an analogy to hiking. But, like many reviews said (and I didn't want to believe) it was VERY repetitive and used the same few examples over and over and over.

I was thinking it was a book about living off grid. It's not. Disappointed, but the book was interesting, in it's own way. I could relate to it, a bit. In my own way, I opt out ocassionally, too. This will appeal to some young person, life's a journey; don't waste it. You should go out on limb and try new stuff, explore while you have the chance. Time enough to maybe pick another route. You have time and it all works out!"

As a childfree, self-employed, serial renter, I have consciously left many of society‚Äôs expectations unmet; but that doesn‚Äôt make the road any easier to walk. Cait normalises every rollercoaster emotion whilst reminding me of the true importance of living in a way that is consistent with my values. I feel refreshed to keep striving forth with courage and ‚Äòhike my own hike‚Äô."
Kyle,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21374693-kyle,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50710787-adventures-in-opting-out,The underlying premise of the book has a lot of promise but the execution just wasn't there. I liked the analogy threaded through the book of hiking and making choices to 'opt out in life.' However Caits examples were not that inspiring or great. One that came up a few times was Cait living in another country but not being able to find accomodations that meet her budget in a few weeks. Would not recommend.

Cait has carved a unique and intentional life for herself, and her honesty and candid writing are refreshing.

What a wonderful second book from Cait Flanders!"

Hyperbole and a Half was, by turns, poignant, clever, insightful, and gut-bustingly funny. Some of the best sections involved the author discussing her battle with depression. While painful to read, there was a stunning clarity to the work. Through anecdotes and analogies, Brosh painted a comprehensible picture of a land which, thank God, I've never had to visit.

It's fairly clear, from the content of Solutions and Other Problems, that Brosh's life has tak"

I was a follower of her blog, which is also the title of her first book (Hyperbole and a Half) and loved her work. But then she practically disappeared right when her book became a best seller. It was strange and worrying. This second book explains a lot about why she seemingly fell off the face of the earth for years, and well, it's not a humorous story unfortunately for her.

And there's a good number of silly animal stories, but I was really expecting myself to chuckle more than once throughout the whole (massive) book.

I have never returned a kindle book I purchased so fast before.

I loved her last book and read her ‚Äúcomic‚Äù for years. I also lauded her for writing so honestly and accurately about depression.

This book üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it‚Äôs an awful, boring memoir with some added illustrations‚Äîand it has that super annoying ‚Äúblogger writes self help book‚Äù feel üëé only to be followed by a depressive spiral. I‚Äôm sad for Allie.

In this one, she deals with being alone, and I‚Äôm sure that is why it took so long to pull this book out of her. Humor as sort of therapy. Humor in sadness.

David Chang is a complex individual as well as multitalented. He probably has as many enemies as he does friends, which is not intentional; it is a byproduct of his brain. While a part of him is creative, visionary, almost ‚Äòout-of-the-box; no, out-of-the-universe, creative; another part of him boils, simmers, like a volcano at 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, raging and fighting against itself.

I loved Momofoku. I never did get into the original restaurant, though did get to Milk Bar. It was one of those books that give me inspiration to cook. This book, not so much. And I'm not sure what I'm supposed to take away from this book. Maybe more sad that a man who achieved such heights into the culinary wor"

Finding redemption for past personal failures requires a clear reckoning and Chang airs his shortcomings without flinching or ignoring the harm to others.

But he also is someone who has done a lot of therapy and is aware of it and trying to do better. Being a celebrity chef is a totally bonkers life.

David Chang's memoir is pretty fascinating- hearing the creative processes behind the creation of the numerous restaurants and concepts under the Momofuku umbrella is pretty wild. Chang is honest about the things that failed and why as well as his successes. It's also honest about his mental health and the role that's played in his career. I didn't realize how far this brand had spread until reading this.

David Chang's memoir is successful in all this - it's funny, self-deprecating, proud, shameful and kindhearted.

Along with Chang's perspective of how he got to where he is today, he touches on many social and mental health issues (sometimes, successfully; sometimes, with the truths of being {like us all} a flawed human). The closing with the worst case / best case scenarios for what the world of food (and beyond) will be in 2035 is really an artful summation of it all."

His personal life, career, leadership, mental health journey, leadership methods and and approach to cooking are all explored in this book which, unsurprisingly from Chang, makes this book difficult to categorize.

As he preaches in his book, Chang is intent on always molting like a lobster, shedding his skin, changing, and growing. He does this in food, but in this memoir he applies the same approach to his life.

Homeland Elegies by Ayad Akhtar
343 pages

What‚Äôs it about?
Ayad Akhtar is a Pulitzer Prize winning playwright and novelist. His newest book is written as a novel, but at times seemed more like a memoir or a collection of short stories. Much like Akhtar, the narrator is a American born man of Pakistani descent. This novel gives us vignettes of the Muslim-American experience and insights into how America got to the place it is now.

What did it make me think about?

MM tells stories that are at once relatable yet deeply remarkable. He's lived an interesting life and a privileged one, though he's also struggled. The way he writes, I often found myself saying, you too? His style is folksy/salt-of-the-earth, and there's a lot of wisdom within the pages.

Recently, I listened to a podcast interview with McConaughey and it really piqued my interest in his life so, I was very excited when I received Greenlights in the mail from Crown Publishing. I sat down on Sunday just to get a taste of the writing style, because truly you never know what you‚Äôre going to get with a high profile celeb memoir, and ‚Ä¶ I just didn‚Äôt stop reading. I read the entire book in one day and, needless to say, I loved it."

The McConaissance, a term coined by a journalist, is what gravitated me toward Mr. McConaughey. This is the time in his career as an actor that he turned on its head. He was typecast as the chiseled, beach-bod jock bankable in every rom-com role. But he desired something more, something deeper. A calling from within drove at his heart like something out of a Poe story. He was determined to lose that typecasting and finally dip his toes in the murky waters of dramatic acting.

A gripping, heartbreaking memoir of a woman who, against all odds, overcomes immense family obstacles to gain an education, opening her eyes to a world she never knew existed.

In the first section of the book we read about Tara's childhood set in the beautiful foothills of Buck's Peak, Idaho.

We soon realize that her dad shows signs of a mental illness - paranoia, depression, illusions of grandeur etc. The most shocking part of the book, is his total disregard for his family's safety, some"

I can see where she is coming from and considering Hinduism is vast, complicated as a subject, practicing is most probably the only true way of being one.

The mundan is a hindi word tho, and she is Tamil-Bengali and not all subcultures do it, and especially for the girl child.

This one and ‚ÄúHelp is on the Way‚Äù were my favorites as Mindy opened up about missing her own mother as she took on the responsibilities of motherhood herself. The other stories kind of felt like blog entries‚Äî they were fun to listen to but weren‚Äôt really too meaningful.

Brooke,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/89045340-brooke,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55054875-kind-of-hindu,"So I'm kind of annoyed that Goodreads made all of these short stories into six separate books instead of just one. But anyway...

This was a fun start to Mindy's new essay collections. This one talked about culture, religion and identity. Mindy wonders what religious aspects she wants to introduce to her daughter as she raises her. I was laughing from the start, of course and it was cute to hear a story about her daughter.

Ready for the next one!"
micki,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7137603-micki,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55054875-kind-of-hindu,"3.5 stars. I'm giving all 6 essays in this collection the same rating since it *is* a collection. Mindy is a fantastic writer but I mostly found this collection ""meh"". Perhaps it's because there were only 6 so I felt dissatisfied--I don't know. I just didn't feel as connected to her as I did in her previous books. I'd still recommend the collection--it's a fast and light read, and Mindy's writing voice is extremely personable."
Shameka,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16787253-shameka,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55054875-kind-of-hindu,This is the first in a series of six essays that Mindy Kaling wrote for her new Amazon book series Nothing Like I Imagined. In Kind of Hindu Mindy reflects on how the birth of her daughter forced her to re-evaluate her connection to her family's Hindu faith. I found this to be an interesting and insightful read. It's not laugh out loud funny but I don't think that it was meant to be. I enjoyed it and I am looking forward to reading some of the other books in the series.
Ridwan,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6028117-ridwan,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55054875-kind-of-hindu,"A brilliant essay on Indentity, Culture and Religion. Mindy captures the emotions and self-doubts of first-generation ""western-born"" child & parent beautifully. I can see myself in this essay and it really gave me an insight on embracing our roots no matter where we are and how far we have come. I could not give a 5 star because I felt like Mindy could have shared more on the topic of being an American-born Confused Desi."
Meredith,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101057-meredith,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55054875-kind-of-hindu,"A brief glimpse into Mindy's as she questions what it means to be Hindu while living in the United States and what cultural values she wants to instill in her daughter. Kaling makes a beautiful revelation about the connection she has with her mother because of the faith and traditions she grew up with, and how those traditions and faith will be her daughter's connection to her grandmother. I look forward to reading more of Kaling's essays."

There are others in the series, but this was a first Mindy Kaling book.

Sadly, this did not work out for me at all. I was disappointed and wondered why I picked it up in the first place. I get that she is being honest, but there were so many comparisons regarding the baby and mundane that I just couldn't enjoy it as much I hoped to."
Ria,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2184974-ria,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55054875-kind-of-hindu,"Another excellent essay, brimming with humour and pathos. And as the mother to a half-Hindu, half-Catholic, yet also kind-of-secular child, it was very reassuring to read about Mindy's own experience and the uncertainty she feels, as religion is and will be a complicated presence in my family life (thanks largely in part to my wholly-Catholic guilt)."

I love Mindy Kaling on on the Office and the other shows that she produces. And this was a really nice story that demonstrates you can have religious ceremonies without mutilation.

For a socially anxious person, it is both flattering and disconcerting to be asked into the holy sacrament of best friendship by a total stranger.

There‚Äôs a misconception that celebrities must love socializing, because all we ever see them do is get dressed up, go to fancy parties, and wait for people to take their picture. But you can be famous and still be shy, a plain introvert, or even a person with social anxiety. I once read somew"

First of all, this title reminds me of her book ‚ÄúWhy is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns).‚Äù

I don't know how Mindy managed to touch on such deep and personal topics in just one short story, but of course she did it. This story was all about social anxiety and being introverted and lonely in a new city with no friends. It was so relatable and she was able to put all my thoughts into words. It felt like I was listening to my friend talk to me.

It just made me smile as she shared her realisations that she would rather be lonely than bored, and rather be lonely than be friends with non-friends. It reminded me when my mum eloquently summed up why I had trouble making friends and socialising with people I didn‚Äôt know, ‚Äúyour problem is that you can‚Äôt st"

I would rather be lonely than bored. I would rather be lonely than to be friends with people that aren't really friends. At the end of the day being with people that don't make you feel seen or alive makes you feel lonelier than being by yourself. Mindy's stories about her introversion, quest to find friends, and social anxiety when she's 40 and well-known assured me that I'm not alone. She"

Written in the honest and self observant way mindy does so well, the woman could be writing about toe nails growing and STILL make it a page turning and realistic commentary,

I'm giving all 6 essays in this collection the same rating since it *is* a collection. Mindy is a fantastic writer but I mostly found this collection ""meh"". Perhaps it's because there were only 6 so I felt dissatisfied--I don't know. I just didn't feel as connected to her as I did in her previous books. I'd still recommend the collection--it's a fast and light read, and Mindy's writing voice is extremely personable."

Can't we all remember a time when our parents just didn't get it?, but in reality it was just us wanting society and our peers to accept us.

SUMMARY
Long time Jeopardy! host and television icon Alex Trebek reflects on his life and career. Since debuting as a host of Jeopardy! in 1984, Alex Trebek has been something like a family member to millions of television viewers, bringing entertainment and education into their homes five nights a week. Last year he made a stunning announcement that he had been diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer. What followed was an"

He just has a public job and he's been doing it for a long time.

That said, I still enjoyed listening to his stories. It was a little odd to have Ken Jennings perform the bulk of the book, since it really made me start hearing this AS Jennings's memoir, instead of Trebek's. Trebek does a few of the chapters, but otherwise, Jennings does it.

Alex comes across as extremely humble. It's almost as if he felt he is not important enough to take up too much of your time and therefore decided to keep things extremely succinct.

The chapters flow by incredibly quickly. Some are just a couple of paragraphs long. Yet, at the end of the book you feel like you learnt so much about him.

This is obviously a must-read for all Jeopardy fans!"

She takes us on a journey through her life (so far) which brought her on a great adventure, one she'd never envisaged for herself but what amazing achievements she made along the way & I have no doubt she will continue to shine whatever she chooses to do next.

We need more caring people like her in the world spreading their stories.

I'm giving all 6 essays in this collection the same rating since it *is* a collection. Mindy is a fantastic writer but I mostly found this collection ""meh"". Perhaps it's because there were only 6 so I felt dissatisfied--I don't know. I just didn't feel as connected to her as I did in her previous books. I'd still recommend the collection--it's a fast and light read, and Mindy's writing voice is extremely personable."
Sophia,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73982645-sophia,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55056141-help-is-on-the-way,"Admitting you need help is one of the hardest things to do as an adult. I‚Äôm happy Mindy used her celebrity status for good: opening up about her journey into motherhood and showing that it‚Äôs okay not to be okay. I don‚Äôt yet have children of my own but hope to some day, and I can only imagine the constant fear of whether what you‚Äôre doing is right, perfect or ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù I‚Äôm glad Mindy found her own normal."
Fatima,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7089995-fatima,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55056141-help-is-on-the-way,"My favourite one so far out of the collection. I have three more to go!

This was such a sweet, heartwarming essay on her first pregnancy & the relationship she built with her daughter‚Äôs nurse, Rose. We also gain some touching insight on Mindy‚Äôs relationship with her mother & her fears about motherhood and the apprehension of asking for help.

I will read anything & everything Mindy has to write! Definite 5 stars for this one. Also - that knee quote made me LOL."
Rochelle,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103561793-rochelle,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55056141-help-is-on-the-way,"""Don't complain, don't explain""; it's a quote Mindy's mother lived by.

In this part of the series she talks about her decision to hire a baby nurse and how that plays out for her. It's emotional, comedic, humane. What I liked about this part is that she has humanized a 'celebrity mom'.
She compares how motherhood was for her mother vis-a-vis herself.

She is single, has lost her mother and is somewhat terrified about motherhood. She finds her way eventually. Kudos to her!"

I love Mindy's conversational style and clean writing. This is a wonderful, emotional fast read that touches on a very difficult thing for many people...asking for and accepting help. Mindy shares her thoughts and emotions so openly that it reads like an email or text from a friend rather than a story you downloaded and read first thing before getting out of bed on a Saturday."

This essay, like the others released in this collection, has made me laugh and cry. Mindy Kaling has long been my idol, and her honesty and voice are comforting.

Mindy‚Äôs story about life postpartum without her mom really resonated with me. Like everything she writes, it is hilarious and brilliantly written.

Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood ~~ Trevor Noah



Trevor Noah's BORN A CRIME is hilarious, heartbreaking & always told through a sympathetic lense. Noah moves from comedy to tragedy seamlessly.

I consider myself an unofficial expert on celebrity memoirs. I haven't read all of them (although I would like to - even the stupid ones, because I am incredibly nosy and devour celebrity gossip the way other people devour Dorritos or fake news), but I've read a fair amount, and they usually follow a typical narrative arc. In BORN A CRIME, Trevor Noah takes that arc, flattens it out, and beats you over the head with it.

Trevor Noah, a comedian and the current host of 'The Daily Show' is a very funny guy.....and I expected this memoir to be full of witty jokes. It's not. The book is about Trevor growing up in South Africa when apartheid was coming to an end. Apartheid and it's aftermath left the impoverished black population of South Africa with hard lives and few opportunities. Nevertheless, Trevor infuses his story with hope and humor.

Funny and sarcastic though exaggerated at times plus a lot descriptions to gross you out. Various patients come with weird situations and I was astonished to learn such things happen in the world. Many of the punchlines went over my head since there are references to TV shows, celebrities and other things I haven't heard of. Besides, it's written in informal style with lots of slang words expressions which I hadn't come across before, so some of them I had to look up on google."

This book is the epitome of what is known as 'gallows humor'. Some parts heart piercing, some parts hilariously funny, but often to the layman extremely crude. The humor of those in the trench, those who face the blood and guts everyday, those who live the life that most of us could not.

Having been a hospital secretary on a trauma unit for about 3 years I can verify a lot of what is written about in this book. It is the diary entries of a young doctor - an intern - or as known in the UK"

Yes there are some funny bits, and lots of gross disgusting tales - you'd expect that - it's all part of a doctor's day-to-day life. What's important is the insiders view of what working for the NHS is like - the highs and terrible lows, the long hours and the strain on personal relationships. Doctors are heroes and often that is something people forget."

A book that sheds some light on what it's like to be a doctor in the UK, the hard work, the endless hours, the responsibility, as well as the shortcomings of the system.

I know many people feel that this is more like a life altering book for them. But that's truly not the same in my case.

1. The book is more like hardcore history which has never been my choice of subject

2. I personally did find the book rather dry as it's major gossip written by a girl whose family is in hiding during World War II

3. I'm 22 and I guess I've grown over a book like this

Anne Frank was a German girl born on June 12, 1929. She was originally from Germany but since her, as well as the rest of the family, were Jewish, they had to move to Amsterdam, Holland, in 1933. For those of you who don‚Äôt know, a Jewish person is someone who was born of a Jewish mother or someone converted to Judaism.

Until she was 17 years old, she had never gone to school and was barely homeschooled. Clearly brilliant, she managed to get into college at Brigham Young and eventually made her w"

Seriously, she doesn't make you believe she's better than she is. She just laughs at the stupidity of life."

I listened to Yes Please recently and could not help comparing the two. Tina reminds me of myself, whereas Amy is very similar to my sister - more open, emotional and sharing.

Trevor Noah, a comedian and the current host of 'The Daily Show' is a very funny guy.....and I expected this memoir to be full of witty jokes. It's not. The book is about Trevor growing up in South Africa when apartheid was coming to an end. Apartheid and it's aftermath left the impoverished black population of South Africa with hard lives and few opportunities. Nevertheless, Trevor infuses his story with hope and humor.

I love this book because it's blunt. Amy describes lots of situations that happened in her life and gives lots of real (and funny!) pieces of advice to the audience. This isn't purely a comedic book and I woul"

Ever since I wanted my first SNL episode and saw Tina Fey and Amy Poehler - well, uh.. I've been in love. If one day these two just walk into my life super randomly and want to hang out or be best friends five-ever (because that's obviously longer than forever -duh!). Well, I'd be one hundred percent down for allllll of that awesomeness. However, my dreams"

I especially loved the parts about Poehler's sons, Archie and Abel. She admits that yes, she would marry Archie any day of the week, and yes, she would eat both her children if there were a kind, loving way to do it. I also loved the (useful!) lists of things she learned from her parents, her frank discussion of her fascination with meth addicts, and the reminder that you make it big not by writing one screenplay, but by doing years of hard, unpa"

I don't have a lot of experince with non-fiction books or memoirs, but I feel like this was a great place to start. I love Amy Poehler as an actress on Parks & Rec, as the host of the Golden Globes and her and Seth Meyers's ""REALLY?!"" scetches are some of my favourites on SNL, like ever. But most of all I love her as a badass, feminist, middle aged, succesful woman who just doesn't give a fuck about anything except for the things she genuinly cares about.

Having seen many positive reviews about this book, I was tempted to give a try.
But sadly, I didn't enjoy it at all.
It didn't seem to be funny as I have expected.
I don't know why I dislike after reading the book but it seems that the audio book is much more fun after seeing other reader's reviews.
I might give another try for the audio version in future but not sure though."

Big confession:

My love for Amy Poehler's work derives almost exclusively from ""Parks and Recreation"" (and her few awards show hosting gigs); her SNL days didn't quite impress me near as much. I don't think it was her fault, though; most SNL fans have a particular era they claim as their favorite, and mine (without reservation) was the amazing 90s. Nearly a decade of hilarity that unfortunately came to a screeching halt upon the tragic death of Phil Hartman in 1998. The show just kinda l"

Things I liked: So, I liked the book overall. Amy Poehler is a fantastic, creative, and humorous woman that made me very happy to have read her book. I loved the format of the book as a whole.

I love Amy Poehler and want to be her when I grow up. So, of course I wanted to read this.

And I liked it! Like most celebrity memoirs, I suspect that she had a lot of ""help"" writing it, and it's not the most amazingly written book in the world. It's a little all over the place, and there are sections that could have been left out. But it's sweet and it's fun. It was a nice book to read during breakfast every morning these past couple of weeks.

I have to say, going into this I was an Amy Poehler fan. I liked her work on SNL, I love her friendship and comedy with Tina Fey...and my heart broke when her and Will Arnett broke up. But this book changed my mind about her...and not in a positive way.

The first has twenty lessons, which are ultimately behaviors to watch for from people in power. In Malala‚Äôs story, she tells of exactly these tyrannical behaviors from the Taliban and Pakistani citizens.

A first I was concerned. The beginning of the book feels choppy and distant. I think the co-writer may have given Malala too much control here and the result is passive text using the past tense almost exclusively. I struggled forward.

When Malala starts to detail the history of Pakistan since its independence in 1947, the book regains"
