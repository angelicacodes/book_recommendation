Leave the World Behind is quiet for an apocalypse novel, more focused on the more mundane everyday mechanism of life than the rampant destruction of life as we know it. Time is spent on long grocery lists and routines that are dully familiar, even though the family is on vacatio"

Leave the World Behind is a story that thrums with tension, which begins to bubble up from underneath as the story goes on. As the characters become more freaked out, you are sure to follow suit, making for a very anxiety-inducing reading experience.

This story is a deft thought experiment of all the 'what-if's you've briefly contemplated‚Äîwhat if you were in a vacation home and someone knocked on your door at night, what if there was a blackout across the entire count"

This book was so disappointing. I really, really wanted to like this, and was so excited when I read the premise. I went in expecting a very unsettling story full of racial tensions, with the undertone of, ""Who are the real bad people?"" and ""What's really out there?""

Pirates of the Caribbean meets Sherlock Holmes!  

I love both of those, so this book was quite fun!  It was more Pirates than Sherlock, I'd say - lots of action and adventure and more of that time period, but the detective duo was very Sherlock.  This would make a terrific and adventurous movie!

A cursed ship. A mysterious warning. A hated, power-hungry nobleman and his prized possession. A detective duo - one of whom is a mercenary with a hidden past."

This story has lots of positives. The setting is beautifully captured as we travel from England to Salem to New York in the 1600s. Women are represented as strong and independent, despite being suppressed and repressed. We clearly see jealousy and vindictiveness in other women and fear in men as causes for witch hysteria.

Well-written and intricately plotted, this book, through no fault of it's own, buzzes a few of my pet peeves right off the bat - multiple POVs and long-(long, long)-game plots. I really only feel invested in the three present-day girls, and the overarching sense of dread on their behalf makes it really hard to pick up the book.

Make sure your schedule is clear and you will want to give your full attention to Plain Bad Heroines by Emily M. Danforth. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I really did need to concentrate. There were footnotes, sly comments, and metafiction to keep your mind engaged. And the gorgeous illustrations throughout by Sara Lautman added another wonderful element to Plain Bad Heroines.

This was a slow read for me, but the story pace wasn‚Äôt slow."

The narration is cool, and the actual craft of the novel is interesting. I'm definitely questioning some of the choices that were made, though. The structure wasn't always totally effective, and did that many queer women have to die in one book? Still, I think plenty of readers will enjoy this book.

Where it is heavy on the sapphic romance, it is no where near a horror story.  Yes, there are deaths and curses but there is nothing that elicits horror, spookiness, or fear in any way.

A ship launches from a distant city bound for Tova and set to arrive on the solstice. The captain of the ship, Xiala, is a disgraced Teek whose song can calm the waters around her as easily as it can warp a man‚Äôs mind. Her ship carries one passenger. Described as harmless, the passenger, Serapio, is a young man, blind, scarred, and cloaked in destiny. (via Goodreads) üìö

This was my most anticipated book of 2020 and IT DIDN'T DISAPPOINT!!!! I'm still reeling from the perfection of this book.

The setting is very traditional fairy tale; small villages, a kingdom, and cursed woods were all painted competently enough. In my opinion that was the strongest aspect of the book. The heroine's power is that her blood can create all manner of plants and foliage, which I think is super cool. It fits the setting nicely.

It started off with this fun adventure to save the kingdom and even though that is an overdone thing in YA fantasy right now, I was super interested in the woodcurse and I loved the idea of a girl and her fox friend saving the kingdom. But that excitement quickly dissipated and I was left creeped out by the budding romance in the story and that completely ruined it f"

It's a fairly simple, straightforward story, that's fast paced and not so heavy on world building, perfect if you're looking for an easy read inbetween books or something light to browse through before going to sleep.

It has a witchy gardener girl, an enchanted fox and a spooky, cursed forest in a magical world, so thematically this was right up my alley. I wouldn't have minded for it to be a longer, more in-depth story, but it was adorable anyways and I went along with it."

Yes? Then look elsewhere.

Because T. Kingfisher‚Äôs newest horror novel, The Hollow Places, isn‚Äôt really a horror novel. And it‚Äôs not super scary.

It‚Äôs a fantasy. More accurately, it‚Äôs a humorous fantasy, with occasional moments of creepy, squirmy Weird/Lovecraftian horror. (And I do mean, occasional. The moments are very few and far between.)

Sophie Kinsella is one of my favorite authors. I'm pretty sure that I've read every book that she has written. So I was beyond excited to read her newest book, Love Your Life.

This book is Chick Lit and takes place in London and Italy. The narrator is Ava (1st person POV).

Ava is quirky and funny and I loved her right from the start. She has a dog named Harold and best girlfriends named Nell, Maud and Sarika.

I'm glad that this book is not at par with her previous releases which sadly, wasn't it for me.

This book has some laugh out loud moments that had me smiling while reading it. Although, do not expect well matured characters because as with her previous books, mostly, the heroines are not.

Still, it was an enjoyable light read especially if you're kind of stress with our current situation. Perfect for chicklit lovers.

And those qualities are on full display from page one. There is a comedic spark in this book that makes it stand out, and it‚Äôs the ideal fictional escape. Wheneve"

Review of the Random House Audio audiobook (October 2020)

Like many Reacher fans, I was alarmed to read that author Lee Child (pseudonym of James Grant) (1954-) was retiring and passing his franchise over to his younger brother Andrew Grant (1968-).

No, Jack Reacher has not ""died"" but, metaphorically, the old Jack Reacher is gone. Andrew Child (Grant) authored this book, having Jack Reacher's character bestowed upon him by his older brother Lee Child (Grant).

Great, if formulaic, Reacher that gets lost in the weeds a bit mid-way but still rewards.

The story is set in the backdrop of the labor movement in Spokane, WA just after the turn of the century.

Actually, after what I thought was a bit of a slow start in this piece of historical fiction, I fell in love with the characters, their various situations/plights and even the setting! It's a fun book full of characters that come to life through Walter's meticulous writing. The descriptions, word choice and conversations are pitch perfect really making the t"
Paula Lyle,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5134026-paula-lyle,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50358038-the-cold-millions,"Jess Walter seems to pick a new genre with each new novel. This time he's written a historical fiction involving Spokane, Washington and the early days of the rise of labor unions. While using the beginning as his premise, he more than makes clear that workers still need and deserve protection from those who would take advantage of us. This isn't a topic that generally interests me, but this is a page-turner and a great read. His characters are always human, surprising and compelling. I really c"

L. Doctorow, with its huge cast consisting of both fictional and real characters, and its opening up of a segment of American history that seldom gets a close look in history classes.

I love Walter's versatility: here's again a new setting for him, timewise. It's Spokane, as in much of his work, but (mainly) 1909, and the context is labor and politics.

It's not that well written for one thing, but the most compelling reason for me not to read more than 56 pages was the rough language and scenarios--which seemed to get worse as the story progressed. I understand that times were rough in the 1900's in Spokane, WA. This reads more like a B Western novel or movie. Most of the story, I believe, is fiction.

Historical fiction populated with interesting non-fiction events and figures such as the Free Speech Law fight in 1909 Spokane, Washington and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn.

Also, 104 years ago today on November 5, 1916, The Bloody Sunday Everett Massacre played out at the dock in Everett, Washington.

Much like many Timothy Egan's books, Walter enriches the knowledge of his grateful readers."

I have loved every book this man has ever written, as it turns out.

The era was a fascinating slice of the battle for workers' rights centering around the 1910 free speech protests in Spokane, WA. Corruption, lies, double-cross, victims, villains, heroes, love, faith, sacrifice, and survival, this story swept me up and brought me home."

The Cold Millions is a tale built amongst the struggle in the early twentieth century for free speech, unionism, and ending the stranglehold that the wealthy had over the workers. Much like Steinbech's East of Eden and Tolstoy's War and Peace (which figures into the novel), the characters are part of the story of the changing times. A talented writer."

Walter is using local history as a foundation for his poignant and fascinating story. It is well written, has an interesting format, and many twists. Walter knows local history but the story could be about many other areas during the early years of the 20th century. He writes about class struggles, power-grabbing officials, greedy businessmen, labor leaders, women's rights/roles, and the struggles of laborers."

The Wobblies (members of the Industrial Workers of the World) are trying to organize and real life activist Elizabeth Gurley Flynn really gets things stirred up.

Great story and characters about the free speech movement and riots in Spokane in 1909 .

Although it took a little while to get acclimated to the topic, I became enraptured with the pacing of this novel, the use of multiple voices and the coverage of events in the late 1800s.

While I find novellas between books of a series unnecessary and boring, this proved to be the exact opposite. I think that if you're intending to read Rhythm of War, you should read this first, for the implications and revelations it has.

Sergio,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4397641-sergio,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54511226-dawnshard,"Truth be told, I don't expect to like Rhythm of War as much as I liked this tightly written, just plain fun, novella. Turns out when restricted to a shorter format and to exploring the corners, edges and side-characters of Roshar, I find myself entertained and compelled just as much, if not more than in the (much, much) longer novels. It helps that Rysn has always been a highlight of the main novels' interludes, and now finds herself undeniably among the best characters of the series."
Sundeep,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49545669-sundeep,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54511226-dawnshard,"Overall, I loved this book. Mostly on the lighter side, which is what I'm looking for these days. Lopen and Rysn were great as main POV characters, as were some of the side characters. The tidbits for overall Cosmere was unexpected.

If I had to nitpick, there were plenty of things happening that it would've needed a much longer book to give them justice, especially the decisions made in the climax."

I really missed this world, and even if The Lopen was the only character that featured in the main parts of the previous books, he was still awesome as always.

And Sanderson putting so much character development into Rysn in some 100 pages shows how great of a storyteller he is.

Also the ending leaves us with more questions than answers as always. Can‚Äôt wait for RoW release next week. HYPE!"

I‚Äôm a sucker for stories that explore new places, creating something new, and making even small, side characters awesome. Rysn shines all over in the book. The amount of work Brandon has done for Rhysn is to be appreciated.

This book has significant Cosmere mysteries. I really liked how he gives just enough information to make fans hungry for more.

I was so glad to see some characters appear and glad to delve into a side character more. I love the perspective of the main character, a unique one you don't see often in literature. This novella also makes the mysteries of Roshar and the Cosmere all the more intriguing.

I did feel that some of the plot was too convenient and a solution to a previous problem too easily solved, pushing believability, thus the four stars."

Personally( and all reviews are personal), I did like the story, but neither the beautiful descriptive language, the setting, or the characters really deeply moved me to put it in a 4 or 5 category."

When Kya was ten, her father had turned to the bottle again and walked out the door of their shack. She learned to survive by living off the land in a coastal marsh in North Carolina.

No other author offers that combination in my opinion. Michael truly walks the middle way with his writing. It was not a perfect book when you break it down to the elements, but that didn't matter due to how engrossed I was in reading. Which is what I'm after in the books I read."

In this book he gets accused of murder. However we don't hear about how the case was put together, which is frustrating. Yes, this is more the legal side of the story (The Mickey Haller books) but still, I wish there was more. It just didn't feel right, and the case and story didn't feel as smooth as the other books.

Dear Mr. Connelly,
Thank you for delivering me from the daily stress of living through the most heinous time of my life. To everyone else this is a fast paced legal thriller that is worth reading slowly, otherwise you'll be back to worrying if you're going to live to read the next one.

And you know what? It is. Not only did I enjoy it thoroughly, but I'm now looking forward to the next one.

To be sure, it's on the grisly side; FBI Special Agent Nina Guerrera was the victim of almost unspeakable acts done by a serial killer/rapist back when she was 16. She turned out to be the one who got away - but not without a ton of physical and emotional scars. As this book begins, she's jogging on a"

Following the success of her Veranda Cruz series, author Isabella Maldonado introduces us to her latest heroine, FBI Special Agent Nina Guerrera, in her upcoming mystery thriller, The Cipher.

As a teenager, Nina managed to escape from a serial killer who was never captured. Years later, Nina has built a career with the FBI. But when a failed assault involving Nina is caught on video and goes viral on the internet, the serial killer takes no"
Steven,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12184725-steven,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53966623-the-cipher,"In this new series, author Maldonado brings a sense of authenticity that one rarely finds in police procedural thrillers. I am sure this is because she is the real deal. Her experience as a police officer should and does bring a real sense that she knows of what she speaks. But that has little to do with literary talent and this is where she shines. The book is real page-turner. It is filled with many memorable characters but it is the heroine, Nina Guerrera, who comes alive in a memorable way."
Mackey,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28470777-mackey,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53966623-the-cipher,"My Amazon First Reads selection for October, The Cipher was an enjoyable piece of crime fiction. Our primary character, Nina, is tough as nails and sigh of relief from the usual protrayal of ditzy female agents. The remaining characters are typical agents but with a biting humor and a great use of word play. One can tell that the author has experience, her writing is detailed and on point.

Pleasently surprised! The story follows an FBI agent who had a rough childhood. After being tortured by a murderer Nina escaped killers grasp and fled to tell the tale. 11 years later he comes back for her...
The story line is well written and fast paced. Keeps the reader entertained and ends well. I would like liked to have the inner mind of the Cipher expanded on but not a major issue.

Overall really enjoyed and I am so incredibly glad it wasn't intertwined with a romance"

I took a little time to get into the book but as soon as I did I was gripped.

A well written story about one of life's fighters.

Spellbreaker is the first in a new duology by Wall Street Journal bestselling author Charlie N. Holmberg.

I listened to the audiobook and really enjoyed it. It was narrated by a man and a woman. Elizabeth Knowelden did a great job; Joel Froomkin was just okay, but it didn't take away much from my enjoyment of the story.

Elsie is an unregistered Spellbreaker. Helped at a young age by a group she calls Cowls she works for them when they need her. She crosses paths with Bacchus and soon the two find themselves caught up in a mystery involving murder.
I really enjoyed this book. It was easy to read and the story flowed from begin to end. The characters were well written and Elsie in particular was likable.

As always, Holmberg's work is wonderful, beautiful and addictive. Unwinding all the details of the tale and the players was a very interesting venture. I can highly recommend any and all of Holmberg's work, but this book is a very different and interesting take on a magical society. It's so different from Paper Magician, but similar in other ways. If you enjoyed Paper Magician, this is definitely worth a read."

I was pleasantly surprised by the small nods to diversity (characters of the lgbt community) throughout the novel that are usually completely absent from the period fantasy genre. Hopefully in the next novel, these will be more than just nods and subtle winks.

The story itself was filled with laughs, excitement and intrigue. Cannot wait for another."

One by One is sharply written, and completely addictive; Ruth Ware took a risky gamble by re-framing the classic locked-room mystery of Agatha Christie, to tell a modern day thriller taking place during a company retreat among snowy mountain.

These are two of my favourite authors and i have to admit i have read all their previous books. They both write the same genre, romance suspense, and have collaborated as co-authors on a couple of series. Taking it in turn to write the novellas, which are approximately 100 pages long. Their writing styles are similar, always well written, fast paced with characters you become invested in.

In the Rogue River series there are 10 books - 5 ea"

Becca,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8901780-becca,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51218287-everything-changes,"Everything Changes

The wonderful cast of characters is rounded out by the introduction of Daemon and his crew (and Grace‚Äôs coworkers). Definitely features a few bad guys, some worse than others. Strong characters who aren‚Äôt afraid to fight for their beliefs in response to bullying. Perfect wrap to the series. I am sad to say goodbye to Creek Canyon."
Susan Vlastelica,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84708383-susan-vlastelica,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51218287-everything-changes,Loved this book! Was nice to have references throughout to the characters who were the ‚Äústars‚Äù in the previous books. Wishing there were more in the series. I laughed out loud at the pedicure segment. Too funny. The story had the romance and a little bit of intrigue. Grace was a well defined character throughout the entire book. Would loved to hear more about Max and his life.

Enjoyable easy read. I like this authors writing as she has just enough detail for me to picture the scenery and people. I come to know the characters and can feel what they do. This book was over way too quickly after waiting a few months for it to come out! Can't wait for the next one from Catherine."

The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was 10 years old. The story is told by the six-year-old Jean Louise Finch.

I read this 20 years ago when I was 14 and I'm kind of sad it's took so long to pick it up again I really do believe we're meant to read this a few times in a lifetime.
For the age of the book and the fact it's told from a child's point of view I think it hits hard where it's supposed to and make us sit up think.

It is a very emotional and compelling read which has fantastic chatacters that will stay with you long after you have finished reading the novel. It has an excellent, emotional and well thought out plot that you only comes across now and again in a book.

The Great Gatsby is an early 20th century classic novel, an extraordinary exploration of a shallow society and the superficial scramble for material wealth and social status, and a man who tries to play the game while trying to recapture a lost love and loses himself in the process.

James Gatz changes his name to Jay Gatsby, reinvents himself, gradually lifts himself to vast wealth (through unsavory means) and a higher social sphere. But he still"

Ruthless Pursuit: ""The Great Gatsby"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald



(Original review, 1981-04-30)



‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby‚Äù is essentially a love story. Daisy turns out to be as unattainable to Jay as Beatrice was to Dante but this being the US, the hero doesn't elevate his idol to muse status; instead he embarks on a ruthless pursuit that ends up destroying him.

And the ending is always resonating in my head. Those humble and yet magnificent words. This writer created a meaningful and beautiful work without sounding pretentious nor mechanical. A remarkable task.
Above all the superficiality of th"

My history: I was a young adult when this first book came out, and the print book never really grabbed me when I gave it a try. I found that I very much enjoyed the American audiobooks with Jim Dale narrating, however, so I read the first few books this way. But this came to an end when I misplaced the fourth book and no longer had a long commute--I never did reach the end of that wretchedly long quidditch game, so I gave up.

First time I'm reading this series from start to finish since ten years ago! SORCERER'S STONE is even more charming and funnier and brilliantly plotted than I remembered, and that said, it's still my least favorite of the series, which is only odd to me because the first books in a series are often my favorite. But in the case of Harry Potter, this exciting rollercoaster only goes up.

According to Orwell, the book reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union.

Orwell, a democratic socialist, was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism, an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the Spanish Civil War. The Soviet Union, he believe"

When I read it again in the not so distant future I will add my own thoughts So here's to what some readers wrote in a couple of other websites.

The unreliable narrator is one of my favorite aspects of literature and Holden Caulfield takes the gold medal in this category. It's also an excellent representation of what depression can do to a person--you feel loneliest when you're around people, you don't feel excited about anything, you self-sabotage, you ramble about feelings you can't articulate.

I always love revisiting Holden every so often. It reminds me of why we need to put an end to the stigma that surrounds"

Such a popular series, so many people have read it or watched the movies... do I really need to do a review? But since I've put it in my top 20 favorite books, isn't there an obligation to review it?

YES

Let's make it simple... it may be young adult, and it may be fantasy, but neither of those facts matter when you have a set of richly flawed characters, a plot that is an absolute play on ""survival of the fittest"" and imagery so vivid it jumps off"

Gradually we get to see the personality traits of Katniss and Peeta, and how they develop as individuals and towards each other. Ka"

Well wow, what did I just read? On the one hand, this book was fascinating and wonderfully written. It is a really gripping dystopian that is made more real by the feeling and thought that it *could* exist (unlike hunger games, etc., which feel more like fiction).

The writing, though hard to follow at times (all dialogue is told from one point of view, so no quotation marks), was incredibly descriptive and beautiful. The characters, especially the main character, were so interesting to"

It gave me a powerful appetite for the genre of dystopia fiction; novels set in a future horrible enough to serve as politically charged cautionary tales. 1984 itself has become, I think, an anodyne used like Nazism to argue against whatever political enemy is currently in the sights of the speaker.

Khaled Hosseini is an AMAZING story teller, it's fascinating how someone can create a person and make you live with it its emotions and thoughts.

William Golding..Lord of the Flies

This book had such an effect on me when I read it as a child. It still remains one of my all time favorites.

Of its Time, yet Classic

I chose to reread Golding's debut novel of 1954 directly after Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe of 1719, since in many ways Golding was writing an anti-Crusoe. Defoe's island castaway works over several decades to impose a personal civilization upon chaos, which eventually permits him to exert the rule of law over savages and mutineers. Golding's English schoolboys, survivors of a Pacific plane crash, appear in school blazers and establish laws among themselves immedia"

Okay, so I have to admit that this might be my least favorite book in the HP series. But, with that being said, I still love it. It's impossible to not love a HP book.

The daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet were of age to marry. In pursuit of having all of them married starting with Jane, the eldest daughter, they attended a ball to which they were invited to meet Charles Bingley, a wealthy young man who recently re"

Elizabeth Bennett is so funny! So is her father, and that is why they get along so well. I don't find Elizabeth to be particularly nerdy or bookish.

One reason : It deserves it.

I'm more of a mystery, thriller kind of person but since the moment I started reading it, I knew I'm going to become a super duper fan of Jane Austen's books.

In both books, a boorish man is reformed through the protagonist's refusal to fall for his original cockishness. And in both books, a late and great scene features some bitch trying to talk the guy out of his reformation. There are differences too, of course: Darcy is just kindof an ass, not a wannabe rapist.

D'Arcy is a Toad: ""Pride and Prejudice"" by Jane Austen



(Original Review, 1981-02-20)



If Jane Austen had never become a novelist, what would have happened? What would have happened to the British? Have Jane Austen's works become an antidote to a harshness in the world? Are they a key to disarming totalitarian societies? To making the world decide to be happier and freer? People read Jane Austen's novels to be entertained, after all."

Okay technically the Alchemist is not a non fiction or self help book but it works on the same level.

Someone said 'The mark of a good book is it changes every time you read it' and this is one of those books that worked for me like that. The first time I read it, while still in school, I dismissed it as a kiddish fable. But with the second and third time my views changed. Maybe that it helped that I was in a different phase of life than my earlier attempts.

It was a toss up for a while there, mainly because the middle section of The Alchemist wasn't holding my attention, as well as the storytelling style, which I'm not used to. I don't mind being told or taught morals as long as there's no heavy moralizing if you will, but generally fables are not my thing. However, Coelho wrapped up his story nicely, so overall I enjoyed following the journey of a humble shepherd even if it was not what I was expecting."
