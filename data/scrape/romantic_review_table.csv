There was a lot to love about this book, time travel, romance, ghosts, not knowing where the story is going to end up, just to name a few. Bronwyn is a fabulous character, strong, determined, unwilling to give everything up for a love interest which I think is so refreshing. Going back to Thorne Manor is not an easy task for Bronwyn, but go back she does. It felt like a journey of self healing in a lot of ways, for more than our leading lady.

I'd give it about 2.5 stars. The twist in the book was something I only figured out about 5 minutes before it actually happened so I'll give the book that.

I was close to hating the ending but it turned out for the better.

I am absolutely in love with the Stay a Spell series and Don't Hex and Drive did not disappoint!

Don't Hex and Drive had all the steam, charm, and mystery as the previous book Wolf Gone Wild! This book is not a PNR rom-com, though, but I don't mind! I love Devraj so much!

First, I really love how Isadora and Devraj met! The book starts off with Isadora daydreaming and getting hit by Devraj while she was on her bike! Sparks fly between the two, but I love how Isadora was imm"

If you are going to have Don't Hex and Drive as a title I'm going to expect some hexing and driving. I didn't really get that. I'm sad.

All jesting aside Don't Hex and Drive is an adult paranormal romance and the second book in a series. Now I didn't read the first book, I was so taken by that title I forgot to check if it was a"

I was interested to see what other story Juliette Cross would tell in this oddly cute and funny fantasy world of hers. It featured lovely sisterly and other feminine friendships. It had a plot.

Isadora is everything I love in a heroine. She's so very sweet, introverted and just adorable. Putting her with Vampire Devraj (ex Bollywood dancer - I mean come one!!!) made me smile so hard.

The Christmas Pact seemed like a movie I've seen countless times. Definitely hallmark, lifetime, or even Netflix worthy! In it, you will meet Riley Kennedy and Kennedy Riley. It honestly felt like fate for these two.. because I would laugh so hard if they got married and she was Riley Riley.

Still dying over it.

The romance and attraction between these two was pretty good. I knew that the whole fake relationship would turn into something - because it always does. It didn"

I loved this book! I really like the banter and humor in books written together by Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward. Their books, even though sometimes are nothing special, do not fail to cheer me up and make me swoon and hopeful. I wish this was longer and so I hope they'll make a full length novel for these characters.

It made me laugh and swoon right from the start. Kennedy was nosy but I like him still. It was also instalove-y but I was okay with it because it worked. Plus it has the fake"

Review of the Audible Original audiobook edition (Dec. 2019)

Admittedly, I am not the target audience for post-Fifty Shades romance fiction, but I thought based on the cover image that this Audible Original would be more along the lines of an old-time Meg Ryan/Tom Hanks rom-com and didn't investigate further when picking it up as a member's monthly freebie.

It was cute, fun, had some humor, and a romance with great chemistry. I can count on Vi Keeland to deliver a romance that I'm sure to enjoy, and this one was right up there even though it was super short! I think my favorite thing about this book was what Keeland did with the names of the main characters. She was Riley Kennedy, and he was Kennedy Riley. How funny that was!

Heather,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1207453-heather,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48988798-the-christmas-pact,"2.5 stars. Relatively enjoyable, but formulaic.

It probably came across as worse because I just finished Jana Aston's Reindeer Falls novellas and it looks lame next to them. They're funny and smart and sassy. This novella starts with one fresh idea - that the H & h have the same names, just reversed - and the rest of the plot is pretty stale.

I also want to say that Kennedy was quite a jerk in the beginning and I had a hard time seeing him as a Hero after that.

But it was free from Audible..."

It reminded me a lot of one of my favorite books, The Hating Game, but there were also differences intertwined. I loved Riley and Kennedy so much. Each of them had pretty significant baggage coming into this ""deal"". Riley was looking for love and Kennedy wasn't sure what he was looking for but commitment wasn't on his radar.

Every Breath is the first Nicholas Sparks book I have read. I wanted to love it but, unfortunately, I was underwhelmed.

Any sparks are tepid at best, and the declarations of love come out of left field.

This has some definite love at first sight but not the ""fake"" kind if that makes sense. Tru and Hope meet in a basically change encounter and they cannot get each other off their minds. This book is almost a reminder of.....crap I can't remember the book now. It is another Nicholas Sparks one about a couple that ends up back together after years. That seems like a Nicholas Sparks reoccuring theme."

It was one of a kind ""chick lit"" or young adult fiction. I liked the idea of two parelell stories interwoven together and narrowly missing each other. The author also touches on important topics like dementia, suicide, grief etc. But since it's suppose to be an easy read, it is not delved into.

I found the end really rushed. The need to tie all loose ends.

The story went by pretty quickly once the trip started. Having gone through a loss recently, I can see Chelsea's point of view of life. The story, in fact, hit a little too close to home with the cancer stuff. The ending was a little predictable. I figured out what was going to happen pretty close to the beginning.

A MUST read!"

While I really enjoyed the idea of this story, it actually fell short of my hopes for it.

The pacing of the story felt too quick and a bit wordy in places. I would have enjoyed spending more time with the heroine enjoying Ireland, France and Italy as the destinations they are rather then just the places where one of her three past loves lived.

I love all of Jenn McKinlay's mysteries. After 5 chapters, I knew I couldn't read any more. The book was putting me into a bad mood. Most of the characters in this book (or at least the part I read) are not likeable. It seems they are either selfish and manipulative or annoyingly arrogant. Maybe if I had read more it would have improved but I will not be coming back. Where was the warmth and charm I usually find in Jenn McKinlay's books?"

It was a great idea to keep Chelsea connected to her current life while she explored the past by revisiting three ex-boyfriends she met after college in a gap year in Europe. Her chemistry with a man in her present that she considers a work rival is tangible (I mean he even has the last name of an Austen hero).

It's the kind of slow burn laugh out loud romantic comedy that involves multiple love interests.

This is my first Nicholas Sparks and it will not be my last. Although formulaic and predicable the book is filled with such genuine sentiment, good values and old-fashioned deliciousness.

I had finished The Choice, another Sparks book, and was highly dissatisfied, but there was a teaser for Two by Two, which I ended up enjoying much more.

Two by Two follows Russ, an ever suffering man, who seems to have it all on the surface, a gorgeous wife, a wonderful young daughter, and a well paying job. But suddenly, all that goes down the drain, and Russ has to figure out how to piece his life back together and what really matters to h"

The relationship between Russ and London was very sweet and i loved Marge and Emily. But the wife, oh my, she got on my nerves. So annoying. And as always, no one breaks a reader's heart like Nicholas Sparks and in a weird way that's what i love about him. A very emotional read."

He has a reason for putting details in the story which at the time can seem odd. He'll use them latter in the story in order to illustrate his two big themes he's trying to demonstrate with his story.

The first major theme he illustrates is on the nature of wisdom. The main character understands what wisdom is but doesn't possess it (by his own reckoning), but all the secondary characters have it and share it with the protagonist. He knows that it (wisdom) comes"

A great story about the love between a father and his daughter; a great story above the love between a brother and his sister; a great story above love lost and found again. And a major dislike toward the main antagonist to offset all the love; however, this character was necessary to make some of the other relationships shine! Good story -- 6 out of 10."

The story started off very slow. As always, the characters were well developed and lovable. The novel wasn't terrible, the plot redeemed itself in the end, but the plot line was incredibly predictable. The typical Sparks writing style that paints pictures of the scenery and creates an escape from daily life was notably absent.

I can appreciate what Sparks has done here. He has changed up his plot formula, keeping relevant and updating his content to stay current from his normal romance plot. It will take a little getting used to though. There are still parts that will break your heart, which is what he's famous for and the writing is easy and relatable. The thing is; his male protagonist was so opposite of his norm that it threw me off. This was not your pensive, broken, moody manly man. Quite the opposite

I feel that Nicholas needs to go back to the writing that made the Notebook and earlier books sooooo great where the characters stood out.

Cannot believe Nicholas Sparks actually wrote this book. I'm halfway through this book and there is not one character I care about. I read someone else's thoughtful review which expressed my own sentiments and gave me the nudge to abandon this one. It was a library book which made it even easier.
Tracey,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6084285-tracey,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40669990-two-by-two,I did not enjoy this book. Usually Sparks can weave a good story in spite of the pedantic writing but not this time. After 100 pages in I was still bored to nearly tears. There were also quite a few typos ...missing words or redundant words ... that I found very annoying. I think I'll be giving up on Sparks after this.

This was an amazing read. I listened to the audiobook, and I really loved the narration of the story. Also, the story was beautiful. I thought that Russ was a fantastic character.

Real people face the unknown with courage, heartache and a hope that at times seems insurmountable but worth the risk. I have yet to pick my jaw up off the floor. Meant To Be is everything a reader wants in a love story but is afraid to ask for. The imagery is spectacular, the emotions are real and it reads like poetic verse. Right on time, hard to forget and easy to fall for. Poppy and Cooper are magic."

He retreated from life, until his sister‚Äôs wedding and saw April Sawyer again. April is a wedding planner and is helping Tyler‚Äôs sister have the wedding of her dreams.

I'm always a fan when an author handles something important in a careful way. This could have gone a bazillion different ways for the main characters and their lives if this secret was to get out. However, it was handled with care and showed not only the importance of it but how life-altering it is for all parties.

Great ending to Cloverleigh Farms."

Cute romance between an actress and an author!

Romance isn't my usual read that's why whenever I find myself involved in a romance novel, I get so excited! This one is clean and funny and cute romance between an actress escaping her lousy marriage and an author who's unusually selling well in South Korea.

What better setting for a romance than Paris! In Marc Levy‚Äôs P.S. From Paris friendship and love bloom. With the aid of friends, the main characters, Paul and Mia, meet, flirt until they‚Äôre friends, and eventually fall in love.

Instead, I spent more time looking up what certain words meant than actually enjoying the story. Surprise! early 19th century language is quite a bit different to today's English. Once I got past my initial confusion, I enjoyed it."

It's a rule that writers are supposed to write what they know. If Austen stayed true to that rule, I really feel bad for her. Because she must have known nothing but shallow, self-absorbed, slightly idiotic people.

Jane Austen‚Äôs Pride and Prejudice is a timeless romance that everyone should read at least once in their lives.

It is a wonderfully true love story, well-written, vivid and engrossing...a romantic page-turner's delight! I could only dream to have a love story like this. AMAZING"

Jane Eyre is the quintessential Victorian novel. It literally has everything that was typical of the period, but, unlike other novels, it has all the elements in one story. At the centre is the romance between Jane and Rochester, which is enhanced by gothic elements such as the uncanniness of the doppleganger and the spectre like qualities of Bertha.

Jane Eyre tells a story of a very likable personage - orphan girl Jane Eyre who, after her parents' deaths lived with her aunt and three cousins who heartily hated her, then at the age of 10 she was sent to a special school-orphanage where after spending 8 years she became a teacher and later a governess at a rich household. As the story progresses we see Jane mature from a young rebelli"

3+ out of 5 stars to Jane Eyre, a wonderful novel written in 1847 by Charlotte Bront√´. I read this book on Spring break just prior to my 21st birthday, perhaps not the best time to take this beauty on. At 21, being a guy, and English major and forced to read a few books I didn't think I'd like, this came at a time where although I liked it, I wasn't as in love with as most others are... hence the 3+ rating.

We meet Jane as a scrawny and reviled nine-year-old living on the heartless charity of her Aunt Reed, enduring the abuse of her loutish cousin John and being punished for his transgressions.

I believe Jane to be the most interesting female protagonist to come from that period in literature. She knows who she is, what she is worth and she refuses to compromise her principles, even when it has heart-breaking consequences. Her integrity and need for inde"

Eleanor & Park is the first young adult novel written by Rainbow Rowell. Published in 2012.

The story follows dual narratives by Eleanor Douglas and Park Sheridan, two misfits living in Omaha, Nebraska from 1986 to 1987.

Eleanor, a chubby 16-year-old girl with curly red hair, and Park, a half-Korean, 16-year-old boy, meet on a school bus on Eleanor's first day at the school and gradually connect through comic books and mix tapes of '80s music, sparking a love story."

Set in 1986, this book is jam-packed with nostalgic references to 80s pop culture, style, and music sprinkled all throughout the story. If you were a teenager during the mid-80s, this story is an emotion-filled 'Back to the Future' Tears for Fears time machine. It's also a love story.

The characters are young, but they are mature for their"

It's 1986. Eleanor is the new girl in school. She lives on the wrong side of the tracks, wears unstylish secondhand clothes on her larger than average body, and has flaming red hair. Basically, she is a walking target."

This is the famous romantic novel, Me Before You, by the author Jojo Moyes, that it was already quite popular before, but now with the movie adaptation has become a reading phenomenon, between the people wanting to read romantic material.

Warning: This book is not a ""romance"" novel.

The focus is the psychological struggle that each character goes through. Will and Lou are fascinating characters that will stick with me for a long time. Their journeys are both staggeringly painful and inspiringly transformative.

This is my first time reading anything from Jojo Moyes and I have to say her writing is awesome. I loved the way the story flowed, the dialogue, and the characters.

The book starts with a prologue of a terrible accident, but doesn't go into much detail. We find out everything later.

After finishing this book, I was sobbing uncontrollably. It really pulled quite a few heartstrings, which I did not expect.


 


 

To be honest, I wasn't really going to re-read this book if the movie with Sam Claflin and Emilia Clark wasn't coming out. But I was so glad I did.

I was expecting a fluff romance. Actually, I knew very little about the story going in, other than the fact that my mom read it before me and sobbed hysterically upon finishing. Naturally I expected Will to die throughout the whole book.

Me Before You is clearly not fluff. It's not even really a romance book. Maybe 70% of the book go by before Lou even realizes she loves Will. Me Before You is less a love story and more a story of two people influencing each other, and one woman t"

You really have to go into this story with an open mind, otherwise you can't make odds or ends of it.

Her first book and it was a winner, and is the template for all the ones to follow. I love how she skewers the society, etiquette & other mannerisms of the times. Did they really use the word ""monstrous"" so much? That kind of threw me in the dialogue, although most was quite witty and nuanced. Great plot, wonderful characters. As multitudes before me have outlined the plot, I will just say that it showcases two sisters who have almost polar opposite approaches to life which ar"

But is Jane Austen really for girls only? Sure, marriage and matchmaking are typically considered women's fare (seriously though, is it only women who marry? ...), and factor predominantly as themes throughout most of Jane Austen's writing, but sociologically she was the voice of realism commenting on her times where one's everything quite directly depended upon marrying well.

It's missing her sparkling humour, though her biting observations were definitely there.

It reads like bad fan faction, which is actually what it is. It was first written as a Bella and Edward Twilight fan fiction before being picked up by a publisher. I guess some are just discovering the genre of BDSM literature and this is their first foray into it. There's much better books out there. I would try ""Comfort Food"" by Kitty Thomas - much better written and the sex is hotter.

I mean seriously, the sex was so awkwardly written."

Twilight was a grand romance which frequently left me smiling, but New Moon takes on a bittersweet, angst-filled and edgy tone in this continuing dramatic saga of teen love between a vampire and a human.

He isn't heard from again until the Epilogue, and that made me realise that he is probably there due to the fact that Jacob has his own POV in Breaking Dawn! Anyway, this au"

I lent Twilight to Cate-across-the-road; we gave her New Moon as a present, and she lent it back to me; most recently, she bought Eclipse, and I borrowed it after she finished. I suggested to her father that the logical next step would be for me to sneak in through her bedroom window and steal Breaking Dawn. I'm not entirely sure he found this funny.

2020 re-read My audio re-read of the Twilight Saga is completed with Breaking Dawn. I‚Äôm a little sad it‚Äôs over, but I was so happy I made the time to re-read these books. It‚Äôs been at least 7-8 years since the last time I re-read them and now I feel completely ready for Midnight Sun in a few weeks! This was my favorite audiobook of the 4 because it had a narrator for Jacob (who I loved) and I have gotten more used to the narrator for Bella, so that‚Äôs a win!"

Some thoughts:

- I do like this more than I dislike it lmao
- I LOVE the comedic banter between Jacob and Rosalie and Bella and Emmett
- Adore the feeling of family between all the Cullens
- Love the friendship between Edward and Jacob
- THRILLED that the horribleness that was the entire Bella-Jacob-Edward drama officially dies in this book.
- Love all the cool vampires we're introduced to


- Kind of hate the entire pregnancy part of the book, honestly kind of grateful that we did"

Wuthering Heights is Emily Bront√´'s only novel. Written between October 1845 and June 1846.
