Readers who enjoy mind-bending mystery novels may expect Stuart Turton‚Äôs The Devil and the Dark Water to follow the same plot lines as other novels in the genre. However, this novel breaks barriers in terms of location, character development, point of view, and much-needed humour mixed in throughout this dark and twisted mystery.

Kingdom of the Wicked (Kingdom of the Wicked #1) by Kerri Maniscalco was one of my most highly anticipated releases of this month. I absolutely adored her Stalking Jack the Ripper series, so my expectations were pretty sky high for her newest series opener. Luckily for me, it mostly pulled it off.

This adds up to make her seem unintelligent and helpless. Plus the tension needed for the romance never really seemed to build to where I felt invested and wanting more.

Emily M. Danforth‚Äôs PLAIN BAD HEROINES is a dark, eerie horror-comedy surrounding a cursed New-England boarding school for girls - a wickedly whimsical celebration of the art of storytelling, sapphic love, and the rebellious female spirit.

This book is a BEAST. It‚Äôs 600+ pages of chaotic gays, hilarious footnotes and a whole load of wasps. Danforth has a knack for making this book feel so real, th"

Danforth‚Äôs writing is ethereal and magnificent, some of the most delectable prose I‚Äôve had the pleasure of experiencing, but her ability to weave such intricate and elaborate storylines together in a way that flows so effortlessly? She‚Äôs a magician, straight up.

The premise for this book was outstanding. I was so excited to read it. Unfortunately what the book purports to be about according to the publishers summary and what it actually focuses on are two very different things.

I thought I was getting a horror comedy with snappy writing, What I got an angsty, whiny romance in which the supposed point of the book takes a back seat to the schlockfest that is the modern timeline characters and their sappy, overwrought romantic feel"

The narration is cool, and the actual craft of the novel is interesting. I'm definitely questioning some of the choices that were made, though.

There was so much to this novella! The narrative follows a group of black women hunting literal KKK monsters in Georgia, and can I say that I am loving this movement of the monstrosity of white supremacy as Lovecraftian monsters? As I said, there is a lot to dig into in such short story, it's rich with history and African folklore as well as some ass-kicking fight scenes from a great group of heroines.

She can see things that are hidden to most, and, in her pursuit of vengeance, wields a mystical blade tied to the spirits of African slaves and chiefs.

But the most important part of reading this book is that it somewhat calmed my fears about what our country is going through now. Apparently there have been many times when we are in upheaval and it seems quite dark. But times change and we weather through it."

He writes about class struggles, power-grabbing officials, greedy businessmen, labor leaders, women's rights/roles, and the struggles of laborers."
Sally,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7465958-sally,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50358038-the-cold-millions,"The novel is set in a fascinating time period in Spokane history, and weaves wonderful characters into a compelling tale. Loved the whole adventure and could barely put it down. One of those rare reads where I will miss the characters and one that will stay with me for a long time.

Beth,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/336739-beth,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50358038-the-cold-millions,"I loved We Live in Water but disliked Beautiful Ruins, and this was somewhere in between. I liked it well enough to finish reading it, but wasn't rushing back to it when I had to put it down. It should do well this fall because it's extremely topical, though, and has some great things to say about the right to protest."
Cathe Olson,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2192498-cathe-olson,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50358038-the-cold-millions,"Historical fiction novel centered on Spokane, WA in the early 1900's. The Wobblies (members of the Industrial Workers of the World) are trying to organize and real life activist Elizabeth Gurley Flynn really gets things stirred up. This novel reminded me a lot of Steinbeck--both in the subject matter and the misfit main characters that give this story so much heart. Very good read!"
Maryellen Woodside,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2234378-maryellen-woodside,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50358038-the-cold-millions,"The novel is set in Spokane, Washington in the early 1900s. We meet the Dolan brothers, dirt poor and trying to get by as best they can. Gig becomes involved with a labor union, the IWW. Rye lucks into a low paying but steady job. The book is their story, but with lots of historical background and a cast of fascinating characters. Great read!"

Two orphaned brothers set out to make a good life for themselves.

Great story and characters about the free speech movement and riots in Spokane in 1909 . Fictional characters are mixed with real actors in the events such as Elizabeth Flynn a labor organizer who went on to head the American Communist party. Also a vivid picture of what the West was like in the early 20th century."

Although it took a little while to get acclimated to the topic, I became enraptured with the pacing of this novel, the use of multiple voices and the coverage of events in the late 1800s. Well researched, although still a work of fiction, the author made the characters come alive. Highly recommended."

This is a beautiful Regency-era fantasy that tackles female empowerment with more gusto (and explicit passion) than any speculative OR historical fiction I‚Äôve read in a long while. Also, C.L. Polk is a Canadian author of colour‚Äîmy favourite kind of writer!

The Midnight Bargain was an interesting historical romance fantasy novel, with themes of feminism and choice at its core.

I found the magic system intriguing and unique. The world building from that perspective was well constructed and written in my opinion. I thought the way magic was used in this book was original and creative, but still easy to understand, which is a strong"

I love Thomas's Charlotte Holmes books but this one is definitely not up to par with the previous ones. It feels rushed, and like it was intended to be a Christmas novella instead of a full novel. The conclusions they make to solve the case involve a lot of leaps of logic and aren't as neat or interesting as the mysteries in the other books. The main Moriarty plot wasn't really pushed forward by much either. Honestly this book could be completely sk"

This series continues to be the best of the best Sherlockian adaptations.

This was a great continuation of where the previous book left off. I felt this one was more romance heavy than the previous books. Of course, that's not a complaint! Ash remains as one of my favorite heroes to date. I enjoyed seeing his growth and how he evolved through the books. I also absolutely loved the adorable flashbacks that gave deeper insight into Charlotte and Ash's history.

I have read books one and two in the series and felt that there was too much carryover from the story lines in the middle books which I have not read which impacted this story.

What I found interesting about this book was that I keenly felt the behavior of men towards women in that time period. The bad guy was a perfect prig and showed the negative side of some men in that time period...women were fragile they shouldn't be educated and they could be manipulated. It is not like this behavior is surprising but it is so well written I had a visceral reaction. I would definitely recommend this book.

An author takes a chance when she writes Holmes fan fiction. It isn't that easy to create a character with Sherlock's talents and Charlotte really doesn't come that close. I guess we're supposed to overlook that and instead take more enjoyment in Charlotte's pursuit of sensual delights than in her pursuit of the criminals. Additionally, too many of the plot lines just didn't make much sense."

Thomas keeps the traditions of a great Sherlock story and adds to it a very modern sensibility. There is the tradition cast of characters, clues and red herrings, London fog and hansom carriages, morsels of cake and missing revolvers. Added to that there are women who redefine themselves based on their own merits, live with overt racism and classism and refuse to allow that limit their bravery.

Laura spent a lot of time in her head and spit out bits of her story in a less than dreary fashion. This is ultimately the story of the fairy tale The Wild Swans and Hans is the favorite brother who's shirt wasn't finished leaving him with a wing. It did hold my attention enough for me to finish the book and maybe had I been more used to the writing style I would have enjoyed it more. I do thank Goodread

His novels have, in turn, spawned their own retellings and adaptations (see Wicked). Maguire's latest novel, A Wild Winter Swan, takes the classic Hans Christian Andersen story of ""The Wild Swans,"" and reimagines it in 1960s New York. Here, Maguire beautifully blends the wonder of a cursed swan prince with the grit and grime of the city to create a moving story filled with magical"

It takes a bit for Hans to appear, but then he‚Äôs still treated as a minor subplot. A plot device without much story or exploration.
I‚Äôm glad Laura got a friend and went to see her mother, but otherwise I thought she didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcome of age‚Äù.

Maguire has reimagined The Wild Swans and set it in 1960s New York, where Laura is dealing with so many changes in her young life. When a boy with a swan's wing appears om Christmas Eve, she is shocked but moves to hide him. Much of the book is about how she does that even as she knows she will be going to a new boarding school in Canada.

I'm still not quite sure what to make of this strange, fantasical little book. It was very realistic except with a strange element of fantasy that finally happened about 20% of the way into the story. The purpose of this element never became clear to me as it really did not seem to truly further the story, but it did make it more interesting.

A Wild Winter Swan is a loosely based retelling of Hans Christian Andersen‚Äôs fairytale The Wild Swans. I love the classic tale, which is very underrated, and so I was excited to read this book. But it wasn‚Äôt quite what I was expecting.

This story focuses on the character Laura, a teenage girl growing up in 1950s New York City and living with her Italian grandparents. This book is first and foremost Laura‚Äôs story. It is a snippet"

Yeah. This was that. And maybe that was the point? Because Laura is a bad writer and ashamed of being seen as dumb?

This was also a book that was pitched as something it was not. Nary an adventure to be seen.

Love how Nonna lost her accent for the big speech at the end.

Why didn't she just ask swan-boy what he liked to eat?"

This one brings together an Italian-American teenage girl in New York in the 1960s and youngest brother from Hans Christian Anderson's The Wild Swans at Christmas. His sister didn't have time to finish the shirt to break his curse, so he still had a swan's wing. Beautifully written and great characters."

The swan only took up maybe 70 pages out of a little over 200. I started skimming towards the end.

I liked Laura and that was the only thing that kept me going in this. The rest of it was ok. I also liked the cook. The swan was strange and not really necessary. It just gave the author a way to sell his book as a retelling. Borrow this if you must read it. It‚Äôs ok."

The story of 15-year-old Laura and her Italian grandparents is held together by fairy tale, and liberally spiced with cook Mary Bernice‚Äôs loving sarcasm, and many verbal gems, such as Nonno‚Äôs confusing, very appropriately, the word ‚Äúadult¬ª with ‚Äúaddled.‚Äù"

There is probably a literary term for stories where things just keep going wrong, one after the next, where every story beat is yet another disaster that you may or may not have seen coming.

The swan boy could have been a stray dog for all he added to the story. It was about an Italian family preparing for an important Christmas dinner party and a young girl struggling to cope with loss and deal with bullies at school. That part of the story was interesting but I don't understand why there were lengthy parts about meal prep while the swan part of the story was so limited."

Because of that, it was more of building up this childish atmosphere through wordplay and Laura's own thought, than any true plot. Laura herself felt vastly younger than the 15 years she was supposedly supposed to have lived.

This is a magical realism story but the same story could have been told without the magic which left me wondering why the boy with one wing was even there."

I liked this dark retelling with many Italian references - Hans Christian Andersen is my favorite fairy tale author. I am 100% Italian and I know the smelly Feast of the 7 Fishes.

I loved WICKED, before I saw the musical. Also, AFTER ALICE, and CONFESSIONS OF AN UGLY STEPSISTER. Sorry to say, I didn't feel the same way about A WILD WINTER SWAN. It seemed like I was reading a first draft, and the rest of the story would be filled in later.

I haven‚Äôt read any of Gregory Maguire‚Äôs other books, so wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, but I enjoyed A Wild Winter Swan, and read it in a day.
It was quirky, a little disturbing, and sometimes charming, combining coming-of-age story with fairy tale in 1960s New York.

Back in the day, I loved Maguire's retellings, but I'd gotten away from them. But I love this tale, and wanted to see what sort of magic Maguire would weave with it. And it's a decent little tale (shorter than anticipated, so yeah, little). But it was lacking a bit in magic and in resolution.

I felt like Maguire either rushed this one or just didn't know how to flesh it out. The story was just lacking, and the resolution was...lackluster and flat.

I couldn't find the strength to finish this because of the MCs. This couple, Lady Beatrice Bentley and Stamford Wright, would have never worked out and as the story progressed, it was difficult to envision a relationship between them.

The author really understands and puts into words the feelings that we all have when we struggle with our self-esteem."

A swamp and a marsh are very different environments. A marsh is a thriving and nurturing place, and it's there, along the North Carolina coast, that Kya lived and survived after being abandoned by her family as a young girl. Kya spent her days alone, observing the surrounding natural world, and it served her well.

Though she loved her marsh dearly, sometimes the loneliness was too much, especially as she gr"

The story and mystery is centered around the simple wholesomeness of Kya and her love of the marsh and all its creatures.

This novel talks about a lot of issues, like seclusion, not fitting into society's ideal image of a proper upholding rights citizen, taking things into your own hands when no one else will help, love that can tear you apart, and standing out on your own.

And the book does tackle these issues brilliantly, with good character development from The Marsh Girl and her family and all...and how she slowly transforms from a girl scare"

There‚Äôs an essence‚Ä¶ something about this story, that reminds me in some overall sense of the fairy tales I used to read as a child, or read to my children when they were young. A story with an underlying message, a warning ‚Äì perhaps a subtler one than being eaten by a wolf ‚Äì but a warning, nonetheless, that the world we live in can often be unkind. This story is like that kind of a warning. Subtle, with signs that you can take or leave, depending on how desperately you want a new story."

Blink, and the years fall away like leaves.




Adeline had wanted to be a tree.
To grow wild and deep, belong to no one but the ground beneath her feet, and the sky above, just like Estele. It would be an unconventional life, and perhaps a little lonely, but at least it would be hers. She would belong to no one but herself.




Day breaks like an egg yolk, spilling light across the field.

E. Schwab has raised the bar on her writing. I am a huge fan of Schwab's books and I've read the majority of the 800 books she has published; some of them more than once and some I've attempted to read in different languages despite only being able to read English fluently.

That hideous word is only just creeping into UK language now and only really used by pre-teens. Please can the editor sort this out?"

The concept for this is imagined very differently to many others of this genre. The storyline had plenty of twists and turns though the ‚Äòmaster‚Äô villain was easily spotted partway through the book. I loved Elsie and Bacchus and the dynamic between them but felt that the relationship was just too slow progressing. Overall I‚Äôll probably read the next book but not right away."

As well, while the ending was engaging enough, it doesn't make up for the first 80% of the book. However, the magic system was fascinating and original, so I've got to give props there.

The 1st chapter i thought this definitely isn't for me but perservered and so glad I did.

I loved the world created in this book. The magic of spellmakers and spellbreakers, a young woman who has been left behind as a six year old and ends up in a workhouse, and a young man looking for a special spell. The major characters had so much depth, and the mysteries just kept adding up.

This book ends in a cliffhanger, so now it's time to look forward to the continuing story."

As always, Holmberg's work is wonderful, beautiful and addictive. Unwinding all the details of the tale and the players was a very interesting venture.

If you enjoyed Paper Magician, this is definitely worth a read."

I was pleasantly surprised by the small nods to diversity (characters of the lgbt community) throughout the novel that are usually completely absent from the period fantasy genre. Hopefully in the next novel, these will be more than just nods and subtle winks.

The story itself was filled with laughs, excitement and intrigue. Cannot wait for another."

This was a fun read - a helpful distraction from the pandemic. I would have rated it a five star, but as I knew I was getting to the final reveal and satisfying conclusion, it just abruptly stopped!

This one was a great read, I'm generally not into ""period stories"" (this one takes place in the 1800s) but it wasn't dry or dull at all - the story moved quickly, the reader really connects with both of the main characters and the plot itself is very interesting.

I love Charlie's work and I suppose when you've written a series as brilliant as the Paper Magician, it's hard to top it. I did enjoy this eventually, meaning it took me half the book to start enjoying, and I will read the next in this duology. I just wouldn't read this one a second time.

I loved the story itself, but something kept niggling away at me the whole time I was reading it. At first, I couldn't figure out what it was, but then I realized two things: (1) the characters: the good people were too good to be real, as in they seemed to have absolutely no flaws (which just isn't humanly possible); the bad people had absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever; they were just evil. (2) The book just seemed shallow, as if i"

The problem with this book for me was probably the fact that it is presented as a prequel to POTE. On its own it is a fine and uncommonly compelling story, though not one of Follet‚Äôs most original.

After my disappointment with Column of Fire, I was pleased to find The Evening and the Morning absorbing. The plot begins realistically and the characters captured my attention and emotions.

The setting, 11th Century England, becomes so real one feels inside it. Follett's characters foster empathy, hope, disgust and enmity and the plot, while sometimes predictable, is at all times interesting and absorbing. The Evening and the Morning is a joy."

The first two thirds of the story were a slower burn, following the classic tropes of gothic horror. I honestly wasn't quite sure how I felt about this one until I got to the turning point. Without getting into spoilers, I will just say that I absolutely loved where the st"

I adore tense stories. I loved Daphne du Maurier‚Äôs, ""Rebecca"", so I jumped at the chance to read a review copy of gothic horror Mexican Gothic via Netgalley. It promised tension, and let me tell you, it delivered. Set in 1950's Mexico in a crumbling old mansion against the backdrop of the misty Hidalgo mountains, it is an opulent eldritch horror that oozes character. Think Lovecraft meets the Brontes. A book for the ""trashy but classy reader"".

This is the first book I've read by this author and it will be released on 11/1/20...and I would highly recommend. KU"

Absolutely loved this novel; it had history, family secrets, pain, compassion - everything to keep the pages turning. Parts of this storyline brought tears reading of the pain Jews suffered in WWII while grasping what the young boy was trying to find in his life. One of the best books I‚Äôve read - it brought thoughtful memories of how families care for each other, even in their desires to guard their hearts."
Abby,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187748-abby,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55522057-this-magnificent-dappled-sea,"This is a good book about the connections between two strangers and how their lives intersect and connect. It is also about family and what defines a family, and this is where I have a huge issue. The author seems to believe that a ‚Äúreal‚Äù family is defined by blood ‚Äì as he repeats throughout the story ‚Äì even though in the story it is clear that family is who loves you and cares for you.

It's an easy read, an interesting story. The downside is that the Italian part doesn't feel Italian enough, but if you just enjoy the story, it's not an issue. The story is about a boy, Luca, in Italy who gets Leukemia. He needs a bone marrow transplant to survive. Because of who the donor is, it unlocks a secret as to who Luca really is and his connection to Jewish refugees trying to get to safety in Switzerland during WWII. Good story."

Great read. I loved the development of each character and how their bonds were formed. We all have others inside of us, be it through genetics or through the experiences we have. Luca was fortunate to have such a great cast of supporters to see him through his illness and as he matured into a man. I loved the history of how some in Italy assisted the Jews during World War II."

This book took me on an emotional and poignant journey, embracing the life of a young Italian boy and his own journey to find his lost family, Jews from the Holocaust he finds out, after having a bone marrow transplant from a Jewish Rabbi, a stranger thousands of miles away, and the interconnectedness he comes across.

The author enlightens us about the Holocaust in Italy, the good and bad people there who helped or turned in the Jews, especially the good people, but that's the back story.

The blend of mystical dreams combined with war torn Italy as background is enough.

I we so draw into the story soon after I began that I could not stop until I read the last word. What a complex story followed the simple beginning.

During 1935-1943, women would ride horses to homes in these mountainous locales, delivering books to families. They would come again the next week to retrieve those books and switch them out with others. These librarians came to know these families and what ki"

It was occasionally hard to follow because it suddenly skipped around in time, but not for long. Perhaps that was just a way to make us pay attention, by jolting us awake now and then.

And he wants to survive to have a wife, have children, live a better life than what's been fished out so far. I find it difficult to review books about the Holocaust because the situation"

5 shining stars!
This book is brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!
I confess that I thought it was based on true facts, so I wasn‚Äôt really interested as I do not read biographies or non-fiction (with some exceptions) but everyone (music lovers?) was talking about it, so, when I found it on sale I just couldn‚Äôt resist. And I‚Äôm so glad I bought a copy.

Don't read this book on your period. Just don't. Take my advice. Spare yourself the grief and agony.

I'd actually been avoiding THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO, because it sounded like more of that gently-padded historical fiction I can't stand, where the past ties into the present of some plucky, Pinterest-and-yoga type, who has her uncertain future resolved by some"

The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a unique, delicious, fun, steamy, and stunning story that reads like a tell-all memoir with rich and scandalous content that had us all flipping those pages as fast as we could. Not one of those pages were boring!

Taylor Jenkins Reid does a fantastic job creating and bringing together realistic, rich, diverse and well-developed characters to life th"

This is the first book I have read by Taylor Jenkins Reid and I was very excited to start it because of all the great reviews here on GR.

Review

‚ÄúDon't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don't do that.‚Äù

People kept talking about The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo; they kept saying how great it was, how everyone should read it. Naturally, I was intrigued by why people loved it so much. I knew that it was about Evelyn (obviously) and a few things about her (such as she's Cuban and bisexual), but I didn't know anything else besides that. And wow.."

The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a story about a famous actress, named Evelyn Hugo, telling her life story to a journalist, named Monique. The intention of this is publishing an authorised biography when Evelyn dies. Evelyn is famous for being an actress, but is also infamous for having seven husbands in her lifetime. The story is mostly Evelyn's, but we do see parts of Monique's life, for the most part being her marriage problems. Most of the st"

It was a page-turner, I'll give it that, and I really do appreciate everything it stood for; the concept is great but the prose... yikes.

I was told this story when I wanted to see it. Reid relies on cliche phrasing much of the time, uses repetition redundantly, and spells out every moment as if the reader is a pre-teen who has just graduated to full-length novels. The timeline is also messy, making the story confusing and the ""plot twist"" in the end more"

Stating the blindingly obvious is our supernatural narrator, none other than Death himself, aka The grim Reaper (an innovative gambit that doesn't quite work, in my opinion).

Almost a book for older children, The Book Thief can also be appreciated by adults.
That said, the jejeune innocence of the book, given that some of the characters' lives are imperiled by Nazi oppression, did begin to niggle after a while.

Too late did the librarian notice the foreign literature on my bedside table and with a distraught expression try to recover 'Outlander';I said firmly: 'Oh no, Madam, I'll read that.'.

I've read that Outlander was originally marketed as a romance novel because the publisher didn't know what else to do with it, but this book is no ordinary romance novel. It doesn't follow any typical romance formula and is a real genre bender that doesn't fit neatly into any one category.

The Help is a 2009 novel by American author Kathryn Stockett.

The Help is set in the early 1960's in Jackson, Mississippi, and told primarily from the first-person perspectives of three women: Aibileen Clark, Minny Jackson, and Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan.

Aibileen is a maid who takes care of children and cleans. Her own 24-year-old son, Treelore, died from an accident on his job. In the story, she is tending the Leefolt household and caring for their toddler, Mae Mobley."

The knocks on it pointed towards a privileged-white-girl-saves-black-woman plot pandering to the white need to feel better about USA's racial segregation issue right up until the recent past.

Criticisms
1) It's too long. It does not need to be 450 pages long. If you shook it I'd say about 100 to 150 pages of filler would fall out.
2) There isn't enough Minny!"

Let me start that I am a rich, privileged white girl from North Eastern America, so I know my review shouldn't be one people look to as a valid opinion or a correct commentary on this book. I have done my research, chatted with multiple people in the bookish community, read many reviews by black readers, and read the different statements put out by the actresses that were in the movie and how they felt that the black women did not get as much of a voice in this story as the white women."

The Help is the story of three powerful women living in Jackson, Mississippi. An empowering tale that is so terrifyingly historically accurate that clearly depicts racism and the way it is ingrained in society.

The Nightingale is a historical fiction novel, written by Kristin Hannah and published in 2015. It tells the story of two sisters, just coming of age in France on the eve of World War II, and their struggle to survive and resist the German occupation of France. It was inspired by the story of a Belgian woman, Andr√©e de Jongh, who helped downed Allied pilots to escape Nazi territory.

This book, like the other two books that I have read by Kristin Hannah, is about family relationships. Two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle, react differently to the Nazi occupation of France. Their father abandoned them years before, but he is still alive and plays an important role in this story.

The book accompanies two sisters through the Nazi Occupation and relates each sister's particular experiences during the War. The sisters are Isabelle, the precocious, altruistic young woman determined to join the French Resistance. The other sister is Vianne, by nature a more traditional type of French housewife. For most of their lives, the sisters are at odd"

If there was something likable in the story I could grit my teeth and bear it, like with A Song of Ice and Fire, but the characters are bland, the story is boring, and the cathedral building details are unnecessary.

I just wasn't sure I trusted the immersion into geisha life that the novel purports to represent. I enjoyed the read, but everything, all the dramatic tension from Sayuri becoming a geisha to auctioning off her virginity, fit way too nicely into a competition between Sayuri and her rival, Hatsumomo.

Not quite! I found it a mildly entertaining read although a little dull. Not a lot happened and I did occasionally wonder what on earth the movie must have been like. I was not sure whether the author really knew what he was writing about - pretty sure there were some Westernised views in there and a few stereotypes.

Despite its popularity, I was hesitant to pick up Memoirs of a Geisha. I know its portrayal of both Japanese and Geisha culture stirred quite the controversy. I, unfortunately, cannot comment on that since my knowledge in both subject areas is limited. Instead, I based my review on the rich narrative, social commentary, and characters of this story. Although I grew up in a different culture and time, I could not help seeing myself in Chiyo.

It was a very well-told story. It had such well-drawn characters. I haven't hated someone as much as I hated Hatsumomo in a long time. Sayuri's story was fascinating and heart-breaking.

Memoirs of a Geisha is a first for me in that I read a book about a geisha.

-The Guernsey island setting, it was just very lovely and summery.

-The characters. Some of them were kind of flat whilst others were a touch too zany (the parrot woman, the pretend Lord), but even with that they were still fun to read about. Also, the friendships and relationships between all the characters was really sweet (if a tad unrealistic).

To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was immediately successful, winning the Pulitzer Prize, and has become a classic of modern American literature. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was 10 years old. The story is told by the six-year-old Jean Louise Finch.

As if I could honestly attempt a review for such an important and iconic book! This is my second read as I was quite young the first time and I think a lot of it went over my head!
To Kill a Mockingbird gives a real and frightening look at the prejudice and discrimination that were rife throughout the deep South during the 1930's USA.

I think this is arguably one of the most well known and well loved classics ever. And it's not hard to understand why - the characters are memorable, the flow of the story is easy to follow for a classic, the writing is lyrical and poetic without being twenty five metaphors deep like some American novels, and probably most importantly it aims to promote an anti-racism, anti-bigotry message"

I thought I did. But then I recently finished reading The Master and Margarita and learned some things. Lots of people think Satan is the ultimate evil, but maybe he isn't. Maybe he is a fallen angel who is not such a bad guy but has been given the task to punish the evil-doers of the world. And most people in Gone with the Wind need to go straight to hell and burn forever.

I was as pleasantly surprised by this novel as any in recent memory.

Gone With The Wind is about so much more than racism. It is about being brain washed into a set of beliefs to marginalize to the point of disbelief that others are just like you.

I first read GWTW when I was in jr. high school and have since read it several times. Like many girls and young women, I got a crush on Rhett Butler with every reading. My younger self admired Scarlett's pluck and resourcefulness, and wished the Civil War had never ruined life on Tara.

Wow. I really enjoyed it! I listened to this mainly on audiobook except for the last 100 pages. The audiobook was great and easy to follow!

My thoughts on the book as a whole is that Margaret Mitchell has guts to write a main character like Scarlett O'Hara. She's a brat, annoying, and just plain unlikable. Then Mitchell does this thing about 1/2 way into the novel and makes Scarlett human. Scarlett is a very strong and opinionated female character.

It did not feel complete without long sentences, obscurity in meanings (as in every thought and feeling comes across always verbal), or big words in every day speech. I've just grown fond of the way classics read, I suppose. The book is set in the 17th century but the writing style feels contemporary because obviously, it was written only 21 ye"

Deconstructing the hagiographic ""Man For All Seasons"" by re-casting More as villain and Cromwell as quasi-hero is not necessarily a bad idea for a novel.

This installment chronicles Claire and Jamie's efforts to prevent the Jacobite rising that Claire knows will end disastrously for"

I first became stuck somewhere around 70%, I believe. The story was just dragging. I managed, with far more time than is usually necessary for me, to make it to the 83% mark b"

Dragonfly in Amber is no ordinary romance novel. In fact, in spite of its romance and paranormal elements, it is far more of a historical novel than anything else in my opinion. This book basks the reader in lush descriptions of 18th century European history, from the political intrigue in the courts of King Louis XV of France, to the everyday life of a merchant, to the inner workings of hospitals of that time. Then it sweeps the reader along, back to the beautiful Scotti"

The issues I had with her characterization was absent in this book. Her pain, anger, bitterness, hope, and love are relayed beautifully.

Okay, this is my third read of this book. The first time I read it, I would rate it 4.5 Stars. Hard to beat the Outlander. The second time I would rate it 4 Stars, only because it wasn't cutting edge anymore and others after were as good or better. I'm hoping this read will be much the same. It is a bridge read.

It took me eons to get through this book, mostly because it's so long and I generally used it as my go-to book in between shorter books or whenever I needed to relax late at night.

I had heard that that this one wasn't as exciting as Book 1 or 3, but I thought it was pretty good. And without a doubt, Diana Gabaldon can write!

I didn't particularly liked season 2 of the Starz show so I was afraid to start it, must confess.
I still liked Outlander more though.
But I am getting ahead of myself; let's return to the beginning.

The love between Jamie and Claire almost feels like it really exists, and you spend the majority if this story waiting for the inevitable to happen that you are told about in the first chapter or so of the book. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because it felt a bit drawn out... definitely drawn out enough that I'm going to take a small break from the series before moving on to Book 3."

If you know me even a little, then you know that I am OBSESSED with anything and everything Outlander. I love Jamie and Claire. If anyone even mentions the series within hearing distance, I jump on the conversation and fangirl hard.

So far, this is my least favorite book in the series. Considering I'm still only on book three, there's still time. However, this book was the slowest. At the end of book one, Jamie lets Claire pick where they're going to go next. Being as Claire is fr"

I‚Äôm continuing to feed the obsession. DRAGONFLY IN AMBER is book two in the Outlander series yet it doesn‚Äôt start off where the last book ends. In fact, I was a little confused to find that Claire is back in her current time in addition to learning that 20 years has lapsed. She now has a daughter and the beginning brings up a lot of questions. I‚Äôm sure if you were like me, you wanted to know what happened since the last book ended for them to end up here.

Alright, I've seen the show, I know the story, and yet... this book thrilled me as if I was discovering everything for the very first time.

I really enjoy Diana Gabaldon's writing. I've read through some reviews on GR and I noticed that a lot of people find her writing needlessly detailed, often straying from the story into long explanations of mundane events from Claire and Jamie's lives, and so on, but I, personally, love that. It made me feel like"

I didn't use to be keen on book series, simply because I feel that writers don't often maintain the same narrative quality or the stories gradually lose their initial attractive as events develop, but that is definitely not the case with Outlander or Dragonfly in Amber.
Gabaldon manages to create perfectly defined characters -even if secondary- that combine exceedingly well with the somet"

The narrative was fine and we play in the world of Paris of 1744, a world that has the Stewarts niggling at Louis to help fund an invasion of Scotland and a resumption of the throne. Parts of this were entertaining and packed full of intrigue and courtly life, and as before, it felt a little like she had researched this crap & by God! it was getting into t"

I‚Äôll be honest I read book 1 and really liked it and left me curious to continue the series but at the same time I was anticipating to be blown away like a lot of my friends when it comes to the series...... But this book! THIS BOOK!! This one did it for me!

Book two in the Outlander series continues the story of Jamie and Claire. But significant time has gone by and Claire is remembering their efforts to thwart the Jacobite uprising ‚Ä¶ both in France, and in Scotland.

Gosh I was bored by much of this. It seemed to take forever to have Jamie back in the picture, and, let‚Äôs face it, it is the sexual tension between him and Claire that is most interesting. That being said, I still fast forwarded through several o"
