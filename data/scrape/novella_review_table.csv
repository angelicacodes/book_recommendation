In Ring Shout, P. Djèlí Clark melds two types of horror, Lovecraftian monsters and the bloody rise of the Ku Klux Klan in 1922 Georgia, as a group of black resistance fighters take on an enemy with frightening supernatural powers.

As Ku Klux Klan members march down the streets of Macon, Georgia on the Fourth of July, Maryse Boudreaux, who narrates the story, watches from a rooftop with her two companions, sharpshooter Sadie and former soldier"

This story follows our two main characters, Avery and Zib. Avery is a cautious perfectionist, while Zib is wild and daring.

Once again the story starts out strong, with witty prose and plenty of intrigue. Then somewhere along the middle it seems to get carried away, confusing us with some nonsense and run-on descriptions of an elusive world beyond. It all leads up to a convoluted and less than satisfying ending.
I did love the whimsy of the writing and the distinctive character building so it is still an enjoyable read."

The others were fine if a bit predictable. This collection would likely not have been published by a lesser known author. The stories seem tossed off, which is my primary disappointment with Oates. I always expect more insight and instead it's just storytelling. Which is fine but a bit disappointing."

These four novellas were so unique, even though each had a female victim as its central character and each had a surprising ending.

The only reason I'm not rounding up is because it was more novella length and the story could have been much more fleshed out.

Also, I don't recommend this one be read as the first book in the series though. It will mean more to you if you get to know the 'children' first through their own books (#1-5)."
Andrea,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29310789-andrea,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52934866-my-last-duchess,"I love this series about the Wildes and was really looking forward to reading how the Duke of Lindow persuaded Ophelia, Lady Astley, to become his third wife and take care of his eight children. How brave she is!
It's a lovely story, even sweet at times. My only wish was that the story could have been a bit longer, so we could see more of the other Wildes as children and teens."

I was eagerly awaiting this book. Thought it sounded like so many of EJ’s earlier book. Disappointing. It was ok and filled a few hours of a cold, rainy, dreary day. But not really very interesting. They meet, fall in love, part for a few days, see each other realize they’re in love and bam story basically over. Ho hum"

This is a prequel book and I didn't realize that from the blurb and at first I thought, have I already read this? Because I recognize a lot of these characters! It totally delivered. Hugo and Ophelia's love story fit them perfectly and explains the blending of their two families. Thanks NetGalley for allowing me early access to read this book!"

I have so thoroughly enjoyed the Wilde stories, and been intrigued by the background love story of the Duke and Duchess. This tale gives their romance substance and a beginning that surely explains how the children came to be the intrepid adults with whom we fall in love! Hugo and Ophelia are people I would love to meet, and they truly deserve their own book!"

This compilation of chapters originally re!eased as a bonus provides the background for the Wilde series. It is a well-done story that sets up the futures of the children of this family and is an enjoyable love story of it's own. Highly recommended plus the novella at the end was fun as well."
Marianne,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1710857-marianne,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52934866-my-last-duchess,I enjoyed rereading (or rereading) My Last Duchess. The relationship between Louisa and Hugo is a definite highlight and I also liked Ophelia and Maddie's bond (I'm looking forward to more of Maddie's story). The scenes where they interacted with Louisa and Lady Fernby were delightful. It was a little difficult to read about Horatius though.

It adds more info about the head of the family that only gets a few on page moments. The whole thing was rather rushed and things happened really fast, but that's due to the length. It's just a fun read, but I would read it only if you've read all the other novels in the series first."
Tara,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102048561-tara,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52934866-my-last-duchess,I loved the Wilde Siblings. And was so excited to read the prequel on The Duke and finding his 3rd wife. Ophelia was sassy and the perfect stepmother for the spunky 8 Wilde children. Loved the story and seeing the personalities of the children before they get their own stories. A fun quick romp from Eloisa that does not disappoint.

Disappointing. I'd read the first third as it had been used as a bribe to buy some of the other books. I think I'd read the best bits. Ophelia and Hugo's romance has so much promise that hasn't been realised.

That's a tough premise to pull off, but I think it sort of succeeds here.

The audiobook production is amazing. I've never done any of the Illuminae books on audio, but they've been highly recommended, so I thought this would be a good place to start: one I wasn't that invested in. It was the right choice, because this one's definitely low on plot and character (obviously, since it's very short), but the full cast performances mad"

One of the few YA series I actually really enjoy. I think it is because AIDAN reminds me of a psychopathic version of the computer crossed with Data, both from Star Trek. I read it for the first time in 2018 to break up my Lord of the Rings binging, and I still look on it fondly, despite my reading tastes having changed drastically in only two years.

I’m utterly and hopelessly obsessed with The Illuminae Files so when I saw that Memento was finally going to be available, I knew I had to read it immediately.

Some Things I Liked

New characters and an old favorite. AIDAN is such an interesting concept and I was so fascinated to learn more about how he studied humans and learned the concepts he references in the rest of the series. Also, I just loved the new characters for this novella.

I felt like there was too much inner monologue going on, and not enough interaction between the two characters.

Max is darkness in every sense of the word and I didn’t know where he was going with this until a certain name popped up and name that sends chills down the spine, but nevertheless I knew Max wasn’t going to let anything or anyone come between him and his Princess.

Disclaimer it’s short and to the point and that ending was perfect fit for a Prince and his Princess. I received an arc copy for an honest and voluntary review."

Amelia Wilde surely poured on the heat and intensity. Maximus definitely delivers time and time again in his Alpha role from start to finish. He's kidnapped our heroine Desiree and now has to decide whether he plans to fulfill his contract or take her for himself! Hold on to your panties ladies, this book soars through some pretty heated scenes to the perfect ending!"
Landy,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40213656-landy,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55223001-taken-at-midnight,This is a quick and dirty story. Desiree just finished playing Cinderella in her school play. Counting down the time to her 18th birthday. Time to celebrate her birthday with a house party. So close but so far she is kidnapped by Maximus who is contracted to take her. Who is Maximus supposed to delivered Desiree to? Will he do it? Who gives Desiree all her first? You definitely have to read to find out.
Vanessa,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38622338-vanessa,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55223001-taken-at-midnight,I’m a big fan of this authors work. So when I decided to read this particular book I was a little disappointed. I understand this book is meant to be a type of novella. So things need to a little more rushed than a full length novel. But for this book it just didn’t work out. I felt as if things were too rushed and there wasn’t enough of an explanation as to what was going on. Although this book was not for me. I will be anxiously waiting to see what the author comes up with next!

I am OBSESSED with this. The only flaw (if I can even call it that is that it's too short. I wanted to stay with Max and Desiree for hundred more pages. But what I got was EVERYTHING.

This is a new author to me and I can’t believe I have waited so long to read her!! Desiree is snatched off the street walking home from her 18th birthday party at midnight by Maximus and held captive. What Max didn’t expect was to fall for his captive. He gives
her two choices- go with the devil or stay here with the devil she knows.... what do you think she picked😉."

For a novella length book there quite a few typos and there’s the whole he tied her wrists but then thinks to himself he should have tied her wrist then it goes back in forth like that so are her wrists tied or not??

Cinderella, only that she likes pain and he likes giving it to her.

Matthew, Duke of Brunswick, suddenly decides to propose to Sarah out of nowhere. What do you think that got him? A big NO! Instead Sarah decides that she must fix Matthew of whatever is making him feel so down. The way that Sarah goes about this is by befriending Matthew. I liked how these characters interacted during their friend times. The love was slow in coming and even Matthew seemed to mess that up. Even after marriage you had to wonder if Matthew can ever love."

This is my first Townsbridge story and I enjoyed it. Matthew, Duke of Brunswick has faced tragedy and is determined to marry only for convienance. His choice is Miss Sarah Townsbridge. She turns his proposal down flat and when she learns of his past, she is determined to help.

They fall in love through a series of encounters and all ends well.

Short and sweet romance."

The hero was not much of a hero at all, and no redeeming qualities as far as I could tell. The heroine was lovely though and shouldn't have been stuck with this situation in my opinion. The chemistry between the two, and the ability to laugh on occasion seemed to be their redeeming qualities as a couple.

I mean, I know they will end up together of course but what trials await them? what obstacles do they face? how do they resolve these conflicts?. A little more excitement and drama would have made me give this more stars"

I do not have anything against wallpaper historicals but this one while not badly written, was too short, superficial and very clichéd. All the characters were essentially cardboard cutouts. Especially the male protagonist who was a poster boy of ""oh noes I cannot possibly catch any feelings because of Man Pain and The Trauma From My Childhood""."

Hilarious and adorable! I loved the banter and chemistry between the two romantic leads, and got quite a few laughs out of it. It wrapped up a little too soon for me; this novella could have easily become a novel if the author had wished to really dive into Matthew's emotional journey. But it was still quite enjoyable in this shortened version.

Rsyn, The Lopen, Chiri-chiri, Cord, and others take a pirate-like boat trip to a mysterious island (view spoiler)

THE GOOD

Sanderson doesn't just show his power of words, but his growth as a writer and listener. Rsyn's suffering jumps off the page. I don't suffer like her but I definitely cried along with her while reading this book. There are going to be soooo many fans with disabilities who will be touched by this book. It doesn't stereotype."

Overall Thoughts
Brandon Sanderson is usually inclusive in his characters. One thing he’s always done well is making the cast of his stories DIVERSE, and — in my opinion — not stereotype races.
He does this partially by making sure none of his characters are traditional humans, but also by just normalizing it.

Dawnshard does this amazingly regarding those with disabilities. The Lopen is a character who had lost an arm before the events of The Way of K"

...yes a 200 page novel is ""Bite-Sized"" in fantasy.

Dawnshard mainly takes place on a ship named ""Wandersail"" that our protagonist Rysn owns. The first thing I noticed was that this gives the novel an adventuring feel. Having an expedition to an unknown island is always something I am intrigued by and the island in question had been mysterious ever since it was mentioned in a previous Stormlight book.

It also succeeds on two fronts: for invested Cosmere fans, this book is stuffed full with teases, reveals, and deeper questions for Rhythm of War and even the depths of the cosmere.

The climax wasn't as engaging as usual in a Sanderson book, yet I liked what happened.

As always with a Sanderson novel there are some really intriguing ideas and some really spicy implications for the cosmere (can't wait to read some theories).

It’s a great story of a few side characters: the always funny Lopen and the intriguing trader Rysn (speaking of which, what’s with all the names with mostly consonants: Ksteld, Drwlan, etc.?).

Getting the perspectives of The Lopen and Rysn was entertaining to say the least, and there were some powerful messages in the story as well. Exciting action and some juicy cosmere tidbits to boot. Let’s just say that, as I anticipate the release of Rhythm of War, Dawnshard was far too short."

I was expecting a fill-in-the-gaps-btween-novels piece, similar to Edgedancer.

I was not expecting....well....that.

Which is to say, Dawnshard is one of the most important installments in the Cosmere.

She's so great. I enjoyed the story as well and as per usual Brandon Sanderson fashion, I have a ton more questions!!!

My only complaint is Lopen. I really can't stand his character mostly. I don't understand why anyone thinks he's funny or a fun character, he's just so annoying. However, it seems at the end there may be some changes in his character so we'll hopefully see if he gets tolerable."

I really missed this world, and even if The Lopen was the only character that featured in the main parts of the previous books, he was still awesome as always.

I was so glad to see some characters appear and glad to delve into a side character more. I love the perspective of the main character, a unique one you don't see often in literature.

I did feel that some of the plot was too convenient and a solution to a previous problem too easily solved, pushing believability, thus the four stars."

The investigation takes them down an unexpected path. This is a novella so it is a fast read. It has a good plot and I like the characters. It was good to revisit characters from previous books in the series, but this could be read as a stand alone. Thank you to net galley for an advanced readers copy."

A Broken Bone the sixth novella in Melinda Leigh and Kendra Elliot's Widow's Island series was a great read. That was not only fast-paced, but suspenseful and utterly engaging. And with interesting and flawed characters plus a few red herrings, I was easily hooked throughout.

Would recommend."

A very short and extremely simple story. Not much intrigue or mystery to this one. To be perfectly honest if you don't read the previous 5 books in this series you would be completely lost. I am a fan of the author but truth be told Widow's Island has lost its charm."

This whole series has been good. The authors have taken each of the characters and focused on a couple at a time. It has given us a true look into each of their lives and the place they fit into Widow’s Island. This novella really gave an unexpected twist to this island that certainly doesn’t seem to be remote when it comes to murders!"
Laura,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57176271-laura,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51092159-a-broken-bone,"Good story

The mystery isn't much of a mystery since the bad guy basically freaks out and add good as admits to crime when confronted. But despite the precipitous end of the murder investigation it's still a fun story because it's character driven. There are some very PG elements of romance and the long term friendships found in a relatively isolated small town."

I really enjoyed both of them and their performance of this book. Unfortunately, the story itself felt a bit lacking for me.

I was looking forward to a short, cute Christmas story and what we got was a hero who started off obnoxiously. I just really don't enjoy the ""school yard"" romance. These characters are supposed to be adults. If the guy likes the girl, shouldn't they be nice to them instead of teasing them like they are 5 years old?

Review of the Audible Original audiobook edition (Dec. 2019)

It probably came across as worse because I just finished Jana Aston's Reindeer Falls novellas and it looks lame next to them. They're funny and smart and sassy. This novella starts with one fresh idea - that the H & h have the same names, just reversed - and the rest of the plot is pretty stale.

It reminded me a lot of one of my favorite books, The Hating Game, but there were also differences intertwined. I loved Riley and Kennedy so much. Each of them had pretty significant baggage coming into this ""deal"". Riley was looking for love and Kennedy wasn't sure what he was looking for but commitment wasn't on his radar.

I have a million reasons to love this book and a million stars to give. SJM not only wrote ACOFAS to expand the ACOWAR world or make it a perfect epilogue for ACOWAR, but she wrote this book for her fans because while reading, I felt every thread of her passion woven into words and the characters that became my beloved family since book one. I loved how she made ACOFAS special and perfect for a holiday reading. Christmas vibes."

Keiko was always a little different in her parents’ eyes. When she went to college, she got a job at a local convenience store. She tried her best to fit in by copying the other employees there, from their clothing to their mannerisms. Life passes by, and many years later, Keiko is still working at the convenience store. No one around Keiko is comfortable with her choice to stay there, but she is content...until she tries her best to change."

The Bob Dylan song ‘You’re Gonna Have to Serve Somebody’ comes to mind when reading this deceptively simple story. In fact, like Dylan’s lyrics, it is a highly sophisticated commentary on the need for human beings to belong to a social group, to have a role, and what happens - good and bad - when they do.

Miss Furukura is acutely aware of the details of human behaviour and speech but she has no emotional reaction to what she experiences. She must learn to fit in by copying"

The store gives her a way to pretend normality - or what her acquaintances and family want for her - but she's"

It was more solidly affirming of being a single woman than all the non fiction books I’ve read lately on the matter.

PS i have a pet peeve against non fiction writers who write book about the wonders of being single, only to say at the end: after all that, I’m happily in a relationship

Sayaka Murata brilliantly captures the atmosphere of the familiar convenience store that is so much part of life in Japan. With some laugh-out-loud moments prompted by the disconnect between Keiko’s thoughts and those of the people around her, she provides a sharp look at Japanese society and the pressure to conform, as well as penetrating insights into the female mind. Convenience Store Woman is a fresh, charming portrait of an unforgettable h"

Although it had a romance tag in Netgalley the story itself had no romance. Only a hint of it here and there and considering the series has 6 books I'm really looking forward for the rest of it. I managed to get my hands on book number 3 and 4 thus I can see the rest of the story too.

This one is ok. I didn't connect with it maybe because previous books have had more action, etc. The investigation was nil and the culprit gave himself away in a very obvious way. This book felt more like a facilitation of a relationship between Cate and Henry than a mystery, crime, procedural, etc. I may read the next one and see if the investigation of the Cate's missing childhood friend is ever solved."

I have read a number of Noelle Adam’s book before and liked them. This was another lighthearted and enjoyable romance, which despite its predicability was fun. I liked Trevor’s character as there was a vulnerability about him, despite the arrogant facade, which was refreshing.
An easy book to read in one sitting without having to think hard."

Whisper of Bone is the third novella in the Widow’s Island series, which follows friends Cate and Tessa as they try and solve the mystery surrounding their childhood friend’s disappearance, as well as solve a few other murders along the way.

This novella continues Tessa’s narrative, which I admit is not my favourite of the two female leads. Together with old friend/new lover Logan, Tessa is called to the discovery of a body washed up on the docks. An"

This novella series is slowly warming up to me. It's quite fun when the mysteries are solved relatively easily and the romance is taken a back seat from everything. With the length of the novel, romance really does not have enough space to spread out on. Just like the previous book this one too has enough going on to keep you interested till the last page and it's short enough you aren't bored."

This is the third novella of the Widows island series and by far the weakest. It was emotionally shallow, the murder lacked suspense or thrill, and I barely connected to the story. Even though it's a novella, I expected more based on the first books in the series. I will finish reading the series and hope this was a one off."

This book is a weak third in the series. It was fairly obvious who the killer was. More time was spent on the romance aspect. In a book this short, I shouldn't expect a lot. Still the culprit hurts his hand and a few pages later, it is a bandaged arm. That is sloppy editing."

Mystery Thriller + Short Story

A good start for a series. We follow a nameless character, I think he calls himself nameless too! He is a vigilante though he rejects to be called that. Ace of Diamonds (Another unknown character) gives him this mission to take down a corrupt cop.

The above is the reason I quit reading Koontz in the first place. It seemed to me that all of his books were the same. After WATCHERS and a few other Koontz books made me quickly fall in love with him, the re-use of that same formula over and over again made me fall out of love with him, just as quickly.

I think that the flow after a bit was a bit off. And I think that Nameless felt like a hybrid of Odd Thomas and a few Koontz heroes mixed in.

I used to be a voracious reader of Dean Koontz back in the 90s and early part of the 2000s, but fell off the bandwagon around the time By the Light of the Moon and a string of other clunkers came out and he traded the intriguing and unfinished Christopher Snow series for the much too-earnest and goofball comedy of Odd Thomas.

In the Heart of Fire is part of a compelling, and highly addictive series by Dean Koontz- about a highly skilled 'killer' dubbed 'Nameless'.

This is the first of six little beauties about ""Nameless"" from the incomparable Dean Koontz. These range from long short stories to short novellas.
From ""In the Heart of the Fire"" to ""Memories of Tomorrow"" (love that title), we follow Nameless as he wreaks vengeance on the powerful, vicious, and corrupt. He does what the justice system fails to do, protect the weak. We're in ""an eye for an eye"" land, so there's violence aplenty.

I like the unknown element we get with the main character, Nameless/Ben Shepherd. He seems to be a bit of a vigilante, but we don't know because he doesn't remember anything about himself but recent events.

I think Dean Koontz does a very good job captivating many audiences. I think the name of this book, In the Heart of The Fire , really is a perfect name for this book cover to cover.

Nameless is a man traveling. His destination unknown until directed by someone’s need for justice. This was my first Dean Koontz book.

The Christmas Blanket brought the holiday vibe. Short and sweet and fill"

That is in part because this story is more interesting, has more moving parts, and has a better villain, but my quick reading is also because I wanted to see if Koontz was going to challenge himself a bit.

He did not.

All Systems Red though… well, all the praise is justified. This is a quirky, entertaining, solid story – a worthy winner of an award that has been tarni"

This is the first of a few short 'novellas', with about 5-8 chapters each- but it certainly reads and feels like a full novel. I mean this is in the highest praise!

Set in a distant future, a team of scientists are sent to a planet to conduct surface tests,  and they are required to bring along a Company-issued droid.

All Systems Red by Martha Wells is A science-fiction novella made for my tastes. The murderbot Diaries is A new series that centers on a robot hacks her own governor thereby making her nearly a person. Murderbot really does not like interacting with people and would rather be on her own. She really doesn't take her job seriously and is quite sarcastic. Bad things have happened and people were killed as a result of her. This is a short adventure, mystery on an unnamed planet.

The idea of an AI beyond humans' control is not novel, but very rarely do you get to see the world through said AI's eyes. Murderbot is funny, a bit antisocial and surprisingly relatable.

I do think it would be a fantastic book for preteens or early teens to read. Especially if they haven't read much SF. Would be a good introduction to a new generation."

But coming across a secunit that's willing to help him be more human like lead to him taking on a job to protect people/clients once again do he can get the information he needs.

This was a very nice follow up on All Systems Red. Wells was very consistent in her ability to balance narrative, characters, and world building all in a fast paced story. I like the choice the she has made in keeping these novellas small and the stories contained, slowly revealing the wider universe as needed. We learn more about this far future universe and how society has organized itself now that it resides among the stars. This book also delved a bit deeper into"

Like many, I absolutely loved the first Murderbot novella and couldn’t wait to see what Wells had in store for us.

The plot is somewhat ‘simpler’ than in the first but this was not a problem for me, especially since the focus was on Murderbot’s sentience, and that of other types of ‘robots/AIs’ populating this universe. The voice is once again perfect, full of feelings, and showcases a complex and fascinating character. The addition of ART was a stroke of genius too.

All I can say is that it was as good as the first one - even though there was less action. To me it's not about the action anyway, the very feast is murderbot's inner monologue(s). So much fun.

Artificial Condition (#2 in The Murderbot Diaries Series) by Martha Wells is A science-fiction series made for my tastes. The murderbot Diaries is A new series that centers on a robot hacks her own governor thereby making her nearly a person.

Bad things have happened and people were killed as a result of her. This is a full length space a"

Murderbot keeps making friends and allies no matter how much it tries to go solo.

Murderbot wanted freedom and it's hard to be considered free if you're still legally owned by another person. Murderbot"

Every Heart a Doorway, the first novella in McGuire's beloved Wayward Children series, features an incredibly eclectic cast of well-developed characters.

Set at Eleanor West's School for Wayward Children, with a magical and dark atmosphere, this story is heavily character driven.

Now I picked it up again, giving it a second chance because I thought it's so short and I have to be able to finish reading it eventually.

Seanan McGuire’s obsession with fairy tales comes through loud and clear in her work. She tends to use fairy tales as a springboard of sorts, but she always lands on a completely uncharted territory. Indexing might be the best example of this, but Every Heart a Doorway isn’t far behind.

What a wonderful little story! From page one I fell in love with the world and all of the quirky characters - everything just seemed to fit. Plus, I could relate to the main character, Nancy. She identified herself as asexual, and it shocked me that I thought the same way she did about relationships and all of that jazz. So that was interesting.

Actual Review:
For a story like this, I feel like it should be longer. However, the way Seanan McGuire writes, its length is perfect at the same time.

Ms. McGuire grounds this fairytalesque novella with many truths about expectations, choice, and relationships, and I also appreciate the themes (self-definition, life as story, among others) but I just can't get past the fact that some of these parents--the ones who loved their children--are going to be depressed and broken people for the rest of their lives, because a missing child means no closure.

This was a great read! I enjoyed the inclusion of diverse characters and how dark this was. I've been seeing around that this is categorized as Adult fiction but I beg to differ.

I’m sorry I misunderstood you, Warner. I’m sorry that I thought you were a monster. And I‘m so sorry for not realizing that there is always a reason behind every action and of course, you had your own reasons for your actions.

I HAVE NEVER READ A NOVELLA SO QUICKLY AND INTENSELY LIKE THIS IN MY LIFE.

The whole entire 109 pages were from Warner's point of view and made me love him more than I already do. And he thinks about Juliette a ton, which may sound a bit obsessive, but it still makes me all happy inside. The ways in which he thinks about her though are so, like, I can't even put it into words. Even though Juliette hates him, I still ship her and Warner together.

After reading Destroy Me, I am completely softened to Warner. I wasn’t sure if I would like him, but there was something in the first book that intrigued me. After reading this, I can most definitely say I understand him much better and I truly do like him. Warner isn’t perfect, but he’s not the man I thought he was. He’s so much more.

This book definitely intrigued me. Being able to see the world through Warner’s eyes was not at all what I thought it would be. The world sees him as a detached, heartless, cruel, and obsessed monster when the truth is much more complicated than that. His life is a deadly chess game and the playing board is a landmine.

It was so nice to read something from Warner's point of view. I liked him before, but now I'm starting to love him. I still don't understand why he's so obsessed with Juliette, although the fact that I don't particularly like her might have something to do with that.

The writing was so much better in this one, Warner's mind is a lot more mature and collected than Juliette's which was quite refreshing. T"

It was ok I suppose but wasn't exactly how I pictured Warner's POV to be. Then again I have a very vague recollection of him and the other characters but I do remember him being this ""bad guy"" and very cold and while we do see that, mostly we just see him being all sad and heart eyed over Juliette which...I don't know how I feel about it.

I suppose I'm a bit disappointed with this novella.

The pros: I didn't think anything could make me change my mind about Warner, but this really was a fascinating perspective to read and it answered a lot of questions and cleared up a lot from Shatter Me that seemed unusual. I will say it's not quite enough to make me simply excuse some of the things he did in that book, but it did explain why his redemption arc will be possible and why people seem to love him so much later down the line. The writing is fast-paced and engaging.

There are pesky humans in the way, as well as their ‘pet’, Miki.

This book takes our murderbot on a very dangerous job when it should have been a simple case but thankfully she is no ordinary bot, it is a kick-butt not that may look human but pass for augmented human. No one would suspect a murderbot! She was certainly right for this job. She also meets another bot...possibly another friend for it? That would be exciting!

Rogue Protocol (#3 in The Murderbot Diaries Series) by Martha Wells is A science-fiction series made for my tastes. The murderbot Diaries is A new series that centers on a robot hacks her own governor thereby making her nearly a person. Murderbot really does not like interacting with people and would rather be on her own. She really doesn't take her job seriously and is quite sarcastic. Bad things have happened and people were killed as a result of her. This is a full length space advent"

Rogue Protocol is a close second favourite in the series for very similar reasons — it feels like a self-contained story and has excellent secondary characters.

Murderbot, so far has been un unexpected treat.

In Exit Strategy Murderbot gets himself into even more trouble than usual and practically the whole book is action as he escapes from seemingly impossible situations and rescues various people against all odds.

It sits on human furniture (something forbidden to SecUnits), looks people in the eye, and even gives a hug! It also realizes that it’s learned a lot about a wide variety of things, and it puts those lessons to good use – because it must protect itself and others from certain death. The conclusion comes to a satisfactory, stand-alone ending, at the same time leaving Murderbot a wide-open future."

My reaction when I realized not only was there going to be a Novella to the Selection series, but one from Prince Maxon's POV-my reaction might have looked a little something like this...

I'm currently reading THE ROYAL WE with the Unapologetic Romance Readers (or the ""Romaniacs"", as Karly calls them), and that put me in the mood for more trashy royal drama. Conveniently, I received a notification that I'm next on the waitlist for THE SELECTION, and since the prequel was available, I thought I'd read it & see what I'm getting myself into.



At its heart, THE SELECTION is an interesting and titillating idea - what happens if"

Now I understood him more clearly. His fears, doubts, and worries were realistic. Some of his thoughts were humorous.

I also learned the King's true motives. He was the one who chose most of the girls for the Selection. It was not a draw! They only tricked the people and told them it was! A really bad move for a King.

This novella shows that Maxon is not very content with his father. He feels pressured by him, as he does from both his parents. He also is pretty shy and was very nervous about the selection. I loved how it showed he wasn't really an arrogant, confident prince. It just made me admire him more.

Even though this novella is so short that it's hard for anything relevant to happen, I found Maxon's point of view very interesting. This story is set between a few days prior to the Selection and its first week, and we get a glimpse of what is going on in Maxon's head when he's still getting around to the idea of finding his future wife among the candidates. It's quite enlightening to find out about his parents' true personalities"

I did enjoy this prequel to The Selection and am curious to see if some of the plot-points mentioned here prove relevant for the final book, The One.

This book was fine. I really liked the themes and ideas it brought up about parents, expectations put on children. I especially liked the beginning, writing style really fitted the story and but on the other hand, I didn‘t care for the plot. The story line itself wasn‘t that interesting for me and it struggled to keep my attention.

Creepy and concise in the vein of the most classic fairytales and with obvious comparisons to classic horror novels, this story has a timeless feel. It's both whimsical and disturbing with a healthy dose of dark humor.

I loved this prequel which is pretty amazing because it's a novella and I generally prefer longer works but this works perfectly. It could be a primer on what not to do as a parent, an adventure story or a cautionary tale. It's about Jack and Jill, unloved twin girls who aged but didn't grow when living in their parents house but when they entered the moors they changed. The story changed along with them. They learned about love and how to be sisters."

Down Among the Sticks and Bones is kind of dark fairytale of twin sisters who have been brought up in the same family but with very different morals. Their parents wanted ""the perfect family"" of parents and two children, a boy and a girl, but they got two girls. So, they decided to each get one girl and bring them up as they saw fit.

Jillian/ Jill was her father’s perfect daughter, he wanted a son but he could work with an adventurous, thrill-seeking, and a bit of a to"

Let's say it's 3.5 stars, because it was more rounded as a story than the first book.

What it comes down to is that I'm simply not enough of a romantic to enjoy this book. The appeal lies squarely in the flowery language written in love poems between two post-human women on opposite sides of a time travel war.

Hello and welcome to my review of 2019's novella This is How you Lose the Time War by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone. Also known as the review where my bad opinions are made manifest because apparently everyone loved this book except for me!

Seems doubtful.

One, I've always been iffy about the epistolary format, which is pretty odd, considering the volumes of letters I've written over my life. (Literally. One friend and I filled a two-inch three-ring binder at college). I mean, maybe that's why; it's too personal to be appropriate to what I feel a story needs. In a lot of letters, there's the weight of history behind them. This set-up, perhaps, could transcend the form, but still, ultimately, t"

utterly impossibly, this book managed to exceed my expectations. do not take me lightly when i say i expected this book to be a masterpiece. and it was more.

literary genre fiction is something so rare it's sometimes considered impossible. This Is How You Lose The Time War laughs in the face of critics who disparage science-fiction, and it is not literary and poetic in spite of being science-fiction, it is entirely both."

This Is How You Lose the Time War is a novella about a love that transcends time, space and humanity.

For some reason this has been marketed as a sci-fi epic (which it isn’t; it’s a romance), causing many readers to be confused and disappointed by the vague plot and nebulous world building. The thing is, both these aspects are just backdrops for the characters’ relationship.
In fact, I think this book will be perfect for readers looking for a slow burn, enemies-to-lovers romance filled with"

This is equal parts beautiful and mind bending. For a novella, it manages to capture the feelings of love, admiration, war, hatred and desire all wrapped up into letters told between Red and Blue. Two agents, designed to hate and destroy each other, yet grow to respect and love each other instead.

It's about Six ""Sky's friend"" and Daniel ""Holder's friend"" and their love story.

A chance encounter in the dark leads eighteen-year-old Daniel and the girl who stumbles across him to profess their love for each other. But this love comes with conditions: they agree it will only last one hour and it will only be make-believe.

Let me start this off by saying: Colleen Hoover you’re a genius.



I loved Daniel’s character from the first description we had of him in Hopeless. He’s charming, fun, hilarious, simple, cocky but sweet, … well ‘’ charismatic ’’ .

Six is the perfect match for him. And I guess they knew that too from the second they saw each other for the first time…

And this is what this story is about… Love at first sight… or… touch.

That’s what we all dream about, right?"

Finding Cinderella by Colleen Hoover is an accompanying novella to the Hopeless series, but can also be read as a stand-alone. My advice is to read it after the other two books, so that you can spot all the references and enjoy another point of view of happily-ever-afters.

4 out of 5 stars to Of Mice and Men, a novel written in 1937 by John Steinbeck.

On its surface, this is a very simple, straight forward story about the relationship between two migrant workers working on a ranch at the turn of the century. However, the real strength of the story is the way in which Steinbeck makes you see through the eyes of his characters, both the main characters and the supporting cast. Being a very short book (actually a novella), I thought Steinbeck did a really good job of describing the complex yet ultimately very strong bond betwee"

This book is sci-fi, but it isn't about action. It is consisting mostly of the internal contemplation of an engineer on a small exploration ship.

It is a journey of space travel, but maybe even more importantly it is the internal journey of one woman. We follow the main character, Ariadne, who's the ideal astronaut. She’s curious, but respectful, ambitious but realistic, and she has limits but they are being pushed.

The prose is fine and her heart shines so clearly. The characters are interesting, the new worlds strange and compelling, but there's just not enough of them. I needed more.

It is also a sad farewell of sorts, from the author to many of her hopeful dreams, and to our dreams as well.

I feel like a better human for having read To Be Taught, If Fortunate.

Becky Chambers's gentle soul comes through in every word; as does the era in which the novella is written, with evident sorrow over the damage we've done to our planet, easy acceptance of sexuality in all of its forms, and an unwavering drive to learn and discover, but not to conquer. In these times of quarantine and isolation, it is only mo"

During a recent read of The First Men in the Moon, by HG Wells, I wondered how an audience of his time period would have seen his wonderful depiction of the Moon and its inhabitants. 150 years on, we can only laugh at the quaint misunderstandings and theories posited by early notions of space travel. So how would it feel without our current context? I imagine it would be a lot like how I felt reading Becky Chambers' To Be Taught, If Fortunate.

This is the kind of story that we read science fiction for. It’s a story that asks big questions and gives very human answers.

In my historical romance obsession of the past year, Courtney Milan’s books have come highly recommended. Brothers Sinister was recommended to me a lot, so I decided to start there. The Governess Affair would have been better in long format, but it sets up the series well.

Basically every time I read a good novella, my main thought is how much better it would have been expanded into a full length novel. The Governess Affair isn’t as shippy as it could be because of the brief format. Hugh"

Ehhhhhh...historical romance isn't my thing, but I'm always trying new genres and I've heard good things about Milan. This isn't a BAD book, but it's obviously not for me. I was rolling my eyes at several scenes (which probably suffered due to the length of the book), and the outcome was pretty much spelled out from chapter 1.

That said, Milan did a more than decent job with the characters and the sexual tension. Definitely some nice sexy times if you know what I mean.

Courtney Milan is an author who has been highly recommended to me on multiple occasions. After reading The Governess Affair I certainly understand why.

This wasn’t quite what I expected based on the blurb – but in a good way. I haven’t been reading as much romance as I used to, particularly historical romance, because the characters and the situation have become increasingly difficult to identify with. Love may conquer a lot, but it doesn’t conquer ALL.

Sure, you could purchase each of these novellas separately, but why would you?

Most of the time, the novellas connected with a series tend to give you insight into side characters, and maybe provide a bit of filler while you wait for the real books to come out.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
I really loved getting more into depth on the character Celaena Sardothien and read about her past.
I love how Celaena, despite being Adarlan’s assassin, likes to read, use cosmetics and shop. It just makes her character that more genuine, the girly side of her is also something that people can relate to. Something that also makes her so good is her ability to show mercy like she did with Ansel.

The Assassin and the Pirate Lord
We’re introduced to Celaena Sardothien, the most feared of Adarlan’s Assassins. She’s only 16-years old and she behaves like an obnoxious teenager. There are signs, though, that she’s got the ability to grow and gain wisdom through experience. Celaena has the goods, however, and there’s a reason she’s considered formidable. This is a short story but has lots of excitement and intrigue. I struggled with the world b"

I should’ve known that reading The Assassin’s Blade would break my heart. Agh.

Okay so when I finished Queen of Shadows, all I could think about was Queen of Shadows. I kept replaying my favorite scenes in my head, and that led me to wanting to read the novellas.

And then there is Sam.... I LOVED HIM SO MUCH! And I can't accept his fate. Even though I knew it will come...just no.

People can bellyache all they want about ""Sarah ruined my ship"" and ""Poor this guy in this book, he was so angry,"" but the truth is that Sam was this series' biggest cruelty and everybody knows it. And most everything else pales in comparison.

I think this is a solid first story to the introduction of Celaena Sardothien. We’re introduced to her as an assassin, as an impulsive teen, as a lover of finery, and as someone who fights for others. We see the Assassin’s Guild, Arobynn, and Sam for the first time as well. Honestly, this lays some great groundwork for the rest of the series."

There are no words to describe how much I admire Celaena. She's one of my all time favorite character and it is really nice to be able to read more about her back story.

Of course she was worthy. She was Celaena Sardothien, gods be damned.

I’m a mess after finishing this. A pure mess. More of a mess than I already am in life. Having already read the first two in the series, I only picked this up because I was waiting on Heir of Fire to arrive, and I can’t help but think that I would have loved Throne of Glass a thousand times more had I read this beforehand. These novellas are so beautifully written, and lace together so easily and effectively to weave a brilliantly intricate yet painful picture of Celaena’s past. I would"

The Assassin and the Pirate Lord: 1 stars
All tell and no show. Boring characters. Weird contrived plot. Only redeeming quality was its adventurous theme.

The Assassin and the Healer: 0 stars if that's possible
I hated how Yrene was portrayed and this was just so pointless. The world would have been just fine without this novella.

The Assassin and the Desert: 1 stars
A toddler could have seen that plot twist coming. Bad and boring the whole way through. Ilias was the only good thing here.

I love this prequel that gives you insight into Celaena and her history. It really explains well how she got to where she is in the beginning of Throne of Glass.

I think you either love these books or you hate them. There doesn't seem to be much in between. Personally, I love these books and I love these characters. Celaena can be a bit of a primadonna, but she is still a teenager. And even though she has her moments, overall she is tough as nails."

This collection of sequential novellas essentially acting as a prequel to Throne of Glass was incredible and an absolute must read.
Not only does it flesh out Celaena's character in essential ways but it adds so much more detail and rich worldbuilding to the story. Throne of Glass took place mostly in the R"

Some people learn to embrace it - to love it. Some endure it through drowning it in sorrow, or by making themselves forget. Others turn it into anger.

I loved it, I think even more so the second time around! I'm so glad I finally decided to reread this, it's been way too long since I've been to Ardalan. I love Sarah's writing style and I love Celaena, with all her hybris and other flaws that she has. I admire the world building"

I was not prepared for the emotions. I love how well done the character development is. I cannnnnnooooottt wait to read more!!

Second read September 2016
Forgot how good these novellas are. They are just rich in detail and backstory. Also yes I know I read it out of order but I couldn't find my copy and I was too eager to keep going with the series. Always read the novellas before book 2 kiddos"

From the third novella and forth, there should be a warning: PROCEED WITH CAUTION AND A VAST AMOUNT OF TISSUES.

These little pieces that actually make an entire coherent novel. These little pieces. I cannot even. I can't even. I can't. I always don't know what to say about any Throne of Glass book, so I'll just comment on a few things.

4 of 5 stars (Please read my rating system further below). THAT WAS AMAZING AND NOW I'M REALLY SAD THAT THIS WAS A PREQUEL. THE SERIES IS NOW SO MUCH BETTER KNOWING WHAT HAPPENED TO CELEANA BEFORE SHE WAS THE KING'S CHAMPION. GOD I LOVED THIS BOOK.

My rating system: (I do use half stars.)
5 - I do not use the 5 star. Not because a book might not be worthy, but because a book is never perfect.

The wonderful story of Celaena began here. Each and every novella in this book is amazing. It will grip you instantly. Extremely entertaining. And just be ready for the heartbreak. I can’t even think about it. I cry every time. I knew what was going to happen and it still didn’t stop me from bawling my eyes out.

Celaena definitely is spoiled and arrogant but that’s what makes her appealing. That’s her style. She knows she is deadly and t"
