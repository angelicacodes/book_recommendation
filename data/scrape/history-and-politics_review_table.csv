Due to deindustrialization, suburbanization, and economic crisis, though, by the mid 70s the city faced declining tax revenue and increasing expenditures, and was forced to borrow extensively from banks. This effectively ended the city's social democracy, putting bankers in charge to write the most important"

New York city was on the verge of bankruptcy and state and federal government including the Ford Administration decided not to bail NYC out and left the city to sort out its problems of a declining tax base fleeing to suburbs and large pockets of poverty. This was a moment when austerity became the default pattern for the city. The now all too familiar
Keen,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66635467-keen,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26792268-fear-city,"Naomi Klein has said that when her book “The Shock Doctrine” came out, that one place many have said she left out, was what happened in New York City during the 70s. She refers to this work in her latest book and insisting that this does a fine job of telling the story and she isn’t wrong.

Phillips-Fein traces the origins of the crisis back to the 60s. Between the late 60s and the mid-70s, half a million jobs disappeared from the city, meaning that more people were in need of the city services. G"

The important thing to realize is that while the budget cuts improved the city's revenue and credit standings, they did not improve the lives of the people living in the city. The outcomes would go against the very rhetoric that was used to push the budget cuts: things like poverty, sickness, unemployment, and crime all increased, not decreased, show"

In this portion, Phillips-Fein uses cherry picked examples to demonstrate the difficulties caused by the City's austerity policies and seems to contend that default may have been a better alternative.

Instead, it's a clear, steady retelling of what turns out to be something of a thrilling ride.

The biggest weakness is the book's clear left wing, and mostly unconvincing, tilt as pre-crisis nyc is painted a triumph of post-war liberalism with the crisis simply being a means for a group of neoliberal elites to crush the order.

The book seems much kinder to Mayor Beame than its thesis would otherwise suggest. He was just a bureaucrat over matched by the situation. I left sympathetic to Beame, understanding the importance of unions in preserving civic life, and with a cautious eye looking at the parallels of the de Blasio administration with the Lindsay administration..."
David,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52399712-david,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26792268-fear-city,"Ms. Phillips-Fein describes how the NY City fiscal crisis of the 1970's marked the beginning of even greater income inequality with remarkable clarity and perspective. This is the finest non-fiction book I've read this year, and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in NY City political history, or social economics in general."
Tim Brown,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3536849-tim-brown,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26792268-fear-city,"Interesting study of when New York City began to turn the corner of economic sustainability. Prescient in that politicians, unions, agencies, and others had to make difficult decisions to keep the city afloat. So far, with nearly $20 trillion in debt and counting, the U.S. doesn't seem prepared to make similar difficult choices and could face a financially precarious future."
Raven,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1736803-raven,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26792268-fear-city,Interesting blow by blow of the causes and immediate results of New York's fiscal crisis. My only critique is that the book seemed to imply that the City could have taken a different approach to managing the crisis (i.e. not simply relied on budget cuts and austerity measures) but was disappointingly vague on what that might have looked like.
Rachel Brodsky,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34309387-rachel-brodsky,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26792268-fear-city,"Phillips-Fein's book illuminates a forgotten New York, before corporate development was the primary aim of the city's government. She clearly outlines how tax dollars that had once supported social programs were instead given away to corporate interests, and how that change hollowed the city into one of haves and have-nots."
Amy,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19447723-amy,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26792268-fear-city,"Excellent, excellent book. Makes a fiscal crisis riveting which is a coup and feels like a must read for New York City history fans especially those working for organizations that came out of this period, such as Prospect Park Alliance. Great perspective on the series of mayors Beame, Koch and what they were reacting against ie post World War II."

Yes, the writing, research, thoughtfulness of the author is outstanding.

It is the direction of the Supreme Court since the early 1970’s, the days of Nixon, that blows me away.

In the last fifty years, the Supreme Court could be judged to be Racist, anti middle class, anti poor, anti consumer, anti Unions, sympathetic to white crimes I.e. bank/stock fraud, anti voting rights, pro corporations,"

Revealed are lives, young and old, urban and rural, partisan and rebel, consumed by the whirlwind created by entrenched power wielding a ra"

Combining secondary scholarship, selected memoirs and personal responses written both publicly and privately, and unparalleled access to long-sealed archives on the Chinese mainland, Dikötter follows the Cultural Revolution from its genesis in Mao's"

The author is a world-class specialist in his field, but it feels like he was writing this book for his colleagues, not the readers who not necessarily know the thousands of names filling the pages of the book. To me, it feels like the author assumed that we all have the basics, and took it from there. While the book contains plenty of useful information, it can certainly benefit from more clarity. A"

To its credit, the work is largely impartial in its description of events and did not seem to me to ever be motivated by ideology.

The work provides a broad overview and timeline and plenty of statistics, but not without taking the time to illustrate the Cultural Revolution's impact on individual lives and families. The events discussed here taught me a lot about the sociological"

To borrow from yet another famous Marxist, I forget which one (though he was borrowing from Hegel): history repeats itself, the first time as tragedy, the second as farce.

I began reading this book amidst the spiraling madness of the Great Progressive Cultural Revolution and I would encourage all others to read it as well to understand the madness that is overtaking us today.

Frank Dikotter does a good job of looking at individuals, both state officials and average citizens, while also describing the wide spread effects of the Cultural Revolution. He also does a good job describing the policies that had occurred from 1949 to the 1960s. I felt that this wrap up didn't come together very well as he jumped around after Mao's death to the 1980s and summe"

He covers the era in depth, with all of the death, denunciations, and economic calmity that happened in this time period (along with some of the ingenuity and entrepreneurship of the times, as well). I found the entry on the Great Leap Forward to be a more fascinating read, but this book is still eye-opening.

The history is grim, as erratic leadership combined with inane economic policy produced a nightmare world of paranoia and oppression.

I think Dikotter's biases were more obvious here than in his boo on the Great Leap Forward, which I read a few years ago, but I'm not sure if it matters. I don't know if there is a way to tell the story of the Cultural Revolution without condemning the people who planned it. Because friends, it was some bad news.

Begins in the early third century BC and really ends with Augustus's principate, est. c. 23 BC. My main beef is with Watt's proclivity to call people by a single name (I don't think you would even know that Julius Caesar's first name was Gaius from this book)--I'm sure he's doing that to help new readers to the topic keep everyone straight, but I think it makes it difficult to go beyond the book, or even find these people online.

The Republic lasted for about 300 years, and was taken down by men who busted political norms and resorted to political violence to seize power. It wasn't an all-at-once type of thing - the deterioration of Republican ideals decayed over 100 years or so, ending in the emperor-ship of Octavian. The parallels between what happened to the Republic and what is happening in the US today are evident.

The point to remember is that Rep"

It's firmly in what historians like Keith Windschuttle would call the 'black armband' view of Australian history, (i.e. the accurate one), and all the better for it. Treating its various subjects with both sympathy and detached humour, it's a dense read but a worthwhile one.

There are deeper dives into the various cor"

Hunt calls a spade a spade, and is understandably even more direct toward the Irish, Tasmanians, & early hipsters.

A book after my own heart. True Girt may very well be the best piece I’ve read this year. I think all reviewers carry personal biases and I’m about to show mine in full force. True Girt is everything it needs to be: It’s digestible, it’s funny and it’s Australian.

First and foremost, True Girt understands where it sits tonally and with regards to it’s depth. It covers almost over a half a century of history with great detail while still remaining accessible to all readers e"

Both laugh-out-loud funny and sad and horrible at the same time, Hunt has done as he set out to do. And the little nuggets of information (e.g. John Batman suffered from syphilis and didn't have much of a nose), often in hilarious footnotes, make the history all the more memorable.
People say history is boring - they're reading the wrong books.
Bring on volume 3!"

So lots more fun (for those who enjoy such ironic and cheeky irreverence) is at hand.

The 1st part of Hunt’s history (Girt) basically ended with the establishment of the colony at Sydney by the end of the 18th-c. Part 2 concentrates on the major developments that took place as “Australia” came into being during the 19th-c, at the end of which the country was on the verge of un"

After realizing this I played through it by having it on in the background as I was doing other things, only getting my attention hooked by random tidbits that came up rather infrequently.

Reich does a great job of eloquently pinpointing some of the key causal factors in the erosion of our shared values and social norms.

McGirr does a great job of providing ample context for understanding a really interesting time period. For example, I didn't realize how much racism and classism was a big part of prohibition. I should've thought about those things, but I think many people get swept away with the romance of the roaring 20s that they don't necessarily think about the cultural forces that were rebelling and creating that excitement. I had no idea how closely the KKK it was working with the other"

I love history - this book was not only about American history, but super enjoyable to read! I'm amazed at how detrimental Prohibition was to America and created more vice then had they left alcohol legal as it was. A true lesson to learn when you attempt to regulate American morals. We could learn a lot from this book - what Americans do in their private life is their business and the government needs to stay out of it. I highly recommend this book to all Americans, not just"

The main argument is that prohibition is responsible for the growth of government in the 20th c. Fine. I guess. But there was also the Great Depression and World War II.

The real problem is this just isn't very well-written. The chapters read a bit like lectures. Very broad. Interested more in abstractions than people.

Prohibition was so transformative, and so complicated, spanned a lot of years and involved all sorts of characters, and"

I grabbed it expecting another tale of the glamorized struggle between bootleggers and Prohibition agents... that I’ve read numerous times. Instead, I got something fresh.

The book starts with the mostly unexamined reasons why prohibition was approved, which was the growing diversity of immigrants to the U.S. and their greater social reliance on alcohol. From the German indulgence with beer to the Italian reliance on wine and the Irish indiscriminate enjoyment of all kinds of alcoholic beverages there was an undertone of nativism and class warfare about prohibition.

Main theme is how the war on alcohol (Prohibition) led to expanded role of federal government and intrusion into citizens' lives. It should be noted that most of this occurred under Republican administrations, contrary to their contention they stood for a less active government role. Much of the wrath of the Prohibition crusade fell on minorities, the poor, and recent immigrants, and it was used as a device to incarcerate and virtually enslave ma"

Interesting engaging read about Thomas Jefferson. I wouldn't really class this as a biography, more a personality sketch well researched.

This isn't a biography of Thomas Jefferson. Instead, Gordon-Reed and Onuf dive deep into how Jefferson thought--about himself, about slavery, about the United States, about politics, about religion and women and visitors and music.

This book humanizes Jefferson a lot, as someone with all the vagaries of our nature. He's ambiguous, erudite and wanting to be loved but also private and thin-skinned. Loving Virginia, but also aware of the fragile state of a new nation. Perhaps envisioning an end to slavery, but feeling limited by the constraints of his time."

He fought with words."" Over the years, as my understanding of the man and his contradictions deepened, I realized how much he was a real person and not simply an exalted sage.

Mike,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/711115-mike,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25622889-most-blessed-of-the-patriarchs,"A great book on Thomas Jefferson by the expert on him - Annette Gordon-Reed. This book is not a traditional biography. It does go through his life chronologically, but it is a bit more thematic in nature as it focuses more on his views on family, slavery, society, etc... there is very little in terms of background information on the Revolution or his specific actions as President, but I don't feel like that this book needed any of it.

Joseph Ellis had it right when he called Jefferson a Sphinx, but Gordon-Reed seeks to bring clarity to the mystery that is Thomas Jefferson. You may not agree with her perspective or conclusions, but it would be a mistake to ignore her book. Illuminating the heart of Jefferson like few others, her view is a necessity."

His love of family, his use of slaves, Sally Hemming and their children are delved into - he was the Patriarch whose job it was to oversee his home. Jefferson loved peace and harmony and tried to create it at Monticello. His successes and failures are outlined. At times the book seemed a bit ponderous and lacked sparkling writing. Maybe that is the price of nuance."

""There is not a young man now living in the United States who will not die an Unitarian.""

About Jefferson:

The patriot, fresh from Freedom's councils come,
Now pleased retires to lash his slaves at home;
Or woo, perhaps, some black Aspasia's charms,
And dream of freedom in his bondsmaid's arms."

Gary,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10048024-gary,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25246348-the-american-slave-coast,"This is an important book. The author's arguments present a very strong case for why the US ended up in a civil war. It's well documented, jumps around a little bit much, and at times can be repetitive. But the authors' case for the slave economy as the impetus of so much US antebellum history is strong. One of the most intriguing arguments regards the opposing desires of South Carolina and Virginia- the first being a slave-needing state, the latter a slave-selling state. The book does a superb"

This was obviously well researched and edited, but not what I was expecting. Reads too much like a textbook to be used for study purposes, not pleasure reading. Gave up around page 500 after a lot of previous skimming. Sorry I made this purchase. It was a total waste of time and money. Yes, I did get the sample first, but the sample section didn't read like the rest of the book."
David Rappoport,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/593450-david-rappoport,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25246348-the-american-slave-coast,"A particularly brutal history of slavery in America. More comprehensive than the subtitle suggests with attention paid to politics, economics, and culture as well as visceral human suffering. One of those rare books that will assault you with truths you didn't know and irrevocably alter your viewpoint."
Jiliyan,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14129530-jiliyan,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25246348-the-american-slave-coast,"Clearly a work of passion. A mixed blessing. I have real objections to Sugar plantations being called as ""death camps"". The tone and agenda takes away from the scholarship.
Ending the international slave trade might have been done to make money for the protectionist slave breeders - But the idea of many motives gets lost in the passion.
To be taken with a grain of salt."
Bull Durham,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57803623-bull-durham,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25246348-the-american-slave-coast,"in a word, the American Horror Story that no one wants to read: “No matter how bad we thought slavery was, it was even worse. There’s no end to it … The history of the slave-breeding industry demonstrates how far the unrestrained pursuit of profit can go.”"
Frederick,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8146637-frederick,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25246348-the-american-slave-coast,very good source for history of slave-breeding industry in Antebellum America. Ties some of the country's earliest financial institutions and people of wealth to breeding enslaved human beings like cattle. The deeper you dig into American racial slavery the worse it looks.

Reading this book, the foundation of so many of our current problems are revealed as having been laid hundreds of years ago.

The American Slave Coast focuses on the full economic implications of the slave trade and slave breeding and what it really meant to create an economy where children are a return on investment, where people are"
Jeffrey Berger,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51356747-jeffrey-berger,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25246348-the-american-slave-coast,Definitely worth reading.

Ned and Constance Sublette write a compelling history of slave breeding without holding back. While some school textbooks gloss over slavery, the Sublettes sugarcoat nothing. Though I found “American Slave Coast” to be well researched and appropriately confrontational, I also found it to be too long. I will say, it was well organized—you"

The book portrays the slave's desperate life, the owner's enthusiastic sadism, and the federal government's indifference/complicity. A key insight is how slaves fit into the Southern economy. While cotton, tobacco, and rice were the crops that provided cash flow, slaves were the asset that paid interest steadily in the form of slave children. But they were an asset that had no value outside the Old South's economic sphere. In order to maintain price"

Many of the ""founding fathers"" were slave owners. Slaves were the unit of value in an early American conquering society that had no government, and no currency. How many slaves you owned determined how rich or poor you were.

Nineteen were jackpots. The remaining 136 people were classified as EKIA (Enemies Killed in Action). The number of jackpots divided by the number of operations gives a 70 percent success rate, but it ignores well over a hundred other people killed along the way.

The argument isn't ""Murder, terror, assassination, Wars of Aggression/Invasions (Hitler's crime) Big Brother, and undermining democracy are wrong."" the argument is ""We're doing it wrong, attacking innocents.""

I respect the level of objection written here. I miss having a President that had to make these types of decisions, but idealogically, I do not agree with the scale that the program has grown to be utilized. Air Force + Germany makes me curious about how Americans would feel about having an airbase for another country on our soil. This is a terrible review.

All those famous senators and representatives, like John C Calhoun, that blur from long ago come back into focus. The importance to the North of preventing the spread of slavery into new territories becomes the anvil upon which the Civil War was forged."

Evolution is mainly regarded as a theory, for explaining a phenomenon such as the survival of a species over another one, which means an epistemological approach towards understanding the reality.

Anne Frank was a German girl born on June 12, 1929. She was originally from Germany but since her, as well as the rest of the family, were Jewish, they had to move to Amsterdam, Holland, in 1933. For those of you who don’t know, a Jewish person is someone who was born of a Jewish mother or someone converted to Judaism.

The Prince by Machiavelli is an old book (goes back to the 1500s) and was written for the ruler of Florence.

It is simple and easy to understand as Machiavelli was trying to provide advice for the Prince and therefore had to be direct.
The book is pretty much a guide that teaches us different ways to rule people.

This was William Seward, the Governor of New York. Seward was a very bright, good story teller and ardently opposed to slavery.

And you should really, really read a book about Lincoln - he's one of the ""Great Figures of History"" who I really think lives up to his billing.

The problem isn't a lack of content and it's not that Goodwin can't write. The problem, instead, is two-fold: (i) she's a sycophant; and (ii) she can't tell a story.

The first problem asserts itself far earlier. She seems to love all her characters (except one) and writes like a fan magazine. That may work in a teen publication, but after a few hundred pages, it gets downright painful.

This book really does cover nearly everything. From the Big Bang to current life on earth, Bill Bryson does wonderful job of breaking down complex theories and concepts to their essential message:

Manny,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21.A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything,"It's easy to nitpick A Short History of Nearly Everything. Bryson, by his own cheerful admission anything but a scientist, makes a fair number of mistakes. He says that all living creatures contain hox genes; he omits Alexander Friedmann and George Gamow from his description of how the Big Bang theory was developed; when talking about Darwin and Paley, he doesn't seem to be aware that Natural Theology was one of Darwin's favorite books and had a huge influence on him. Those are just a few of the"

As I've repeatedly mentioned over the years, every time one of the casual-readers tells me I have to read something, like Harry Potter or the DaVinci Code, I dig my feet in deeper and resolve to never read it. This is one of the occasions I should have shaved a decade off of my stubbornne"

Bryson's book combines the best qualities of science writers like Attenborough, Diamond, Durrell, and Wilson; presenting the information with the wit he is most known for. It is an amazing achievement to condense the entire base of human scientific knowledge into 478 pages, but Bryson has done it. I completely agree with Tim Flannery, who writes on the jacket that ""all schools would be better places if it were the core sci"

At the grammar school I attended we were shepherded into laboratories for lessons on physics, chemistry and biology. These were scary places; I’d never been anywhere like this before. The physics lab had gas taps and Bunsen burners and the walls were filled with incomprehensible charts. The chemistry lab held rows of specimen jars, more gas taps and burners and an underlying smell of something unpleasant and vaguely dangerous. The biology lab displayed pictures a"

Clearly Bill Bryson has done a lot of hard work and research. This book is one of the examples of how to learn, acquire knowledge, along with wisdom at the same time. The focus of the book is on learning lessons from history and the past, so that there's a better future.

This highly recommended book should be made part of the school syllabus."

The title is hyperbolic; this is an introduction to scientific building blocks that will give the reader a basic understanding about the world, our place within it, and of the history behind major scientific discoveries.

The book certainly isn't comprehensive in any sense of the word--in fact it seems to roam in a semi-random sort of way; but the author's sense of humor and attention to colorful historical facts kept my interest from beginning to end.

One of the themes of this book, is that when someone comes up with with a new discovery, there are three stages before it is accepted:

This is one of those books where I realised after a few pages that I couldn't even plan to write this book, let alone put the words on to the page.

“A Short History of Nearly Everything” is in a word fascinating…mostly. I found this text the most interesting when Bill Bryson turned his attention to the personalities in the science world as opposed to lots of the science itself.

In addition to introducing us to the ideas that shape the way we see the world, the author also takes us into the adventure of science. He takes into the hardships and heartaches, the often petty, ego-d"

There is a degree of story-telling that Bryson utilises that makes the narrative smooth and easy to follow.

The proletariat’s lot in life was bleak in 1848. The Communist Manifesto was created in this atmosphere — that is immediately preceding wide scale revolution in Europe.

Karl Marx and Joseph Engels, the authors of the Communist Manifesto, were in their late twenties when the nascent Communist League published their creed in 1848. The two men were not yet famous but had been involved for the better part of a decade in anti-bourgeoisie groups (agrarian reformers, chartists) before"

Note: This is a review of the Manifesto itself, which occupies all of 40 pages in this edition.

The Communist Manifesto (1848), one of the most influential pieces of political theory, argues for a revolution by the proletariat - the working class - against the ruling bourgeoisie, the middle class which owns the factories in which the former work.

It's contents can be paraphrased (but not in a way that does full justice to the text) thus:

by Jared Diamond

This is not light reading. The author goes into a lot of detail covering a wide range of evidence supporting his thesis. But damn it’s interesting.

The premise for the book is stated in the first chapter “Yali’s Question”. That is why did some societies/people advance differently than others. For instance, why did the people of Eurasia develop so many products and the people of Guinea remain basically hunter-gathers. The author rephrases this question and won"

Most of the book is an anthropological speculation on why some peoples/regions developed faster than others, mostly looking at the origins & conditions for animal domestication and farming vs. hunter/gatherer societies. All speculative, of course. To my disappointment, the ""Steel"" and ""Guns"" part of the title are hardly mentioned at all. I would have preferred more of the latter and a bit less of the former.

Read a representative sample of reviews on Goodreads and you'll appreciate how polarizing A People's History of the United States is.

This book actually starts off really great! Zinn starts out warning the reader he will not be taking a neutral stance and says he will view history only from the oppressed. He then starts off doing just that, watching the invasion of the Americas from the point of view of the natives, the revolution from the poor, slavery from those enslaved, etc etc etc. All good"

Arawak tribesmen, native Americans, see the European ships of Columbus in harbor. Columbus and his men demand to be taken to gold. So begins the injustice. In the process submit the tribes to slavery, torture and death.

“The Warmth of Other Suns” is Wilkerson’s first book.

Based on more than a thousand interviews, written in broad imaginative strokes, this book, at 622 pages, is something of an anomaly in today’s shrinking world of nonfiction publishing: a narrative epic rigorous enough to impress all but the"

It provides the opening to this book. A migrant from Mississippi, he set out on his journey in 1927 for Chicago.

So I thought that Shirer’s book would be a simple re-hash – it wasn’t.

Diaries, schedules, testimonies from the Nuremberg trials, the minutes of meetings, and much more were the raw material marshalled to create this tome.

Hitler was basically obvious about his intentions from the beginning. He may have lied in the short term, but his long term plans were plainly stated.

Kids are taught the multiplication tables, but otherwise everything in elementary school is a worksheet of themed tasks around the idea of George Washington (for example) that will involve coloring a picture of a cherry tree. I could be wrong, but it looks as though elementary school is mostly accreting layers of folklore indirectly.

Loewen takes a critical look at American history textbooks. What he finds are feel good narratives of America's inevitable progress. These narrative sweep over the problems and issues that have face our society. This leaves students with a poor understanding of why things happened, and leaves them powerless to make change in their own society."

I went into ""The New Jim Crow"" with high expectations, but ended feeling a little underwhelmed. Overall, this was a 3.5 star book for me.

While there are several good points in this admittedly short book, the author ranges from reactionary hysteria to empty talking points. I'd hoped that this would cover (however briefly) key tyrannical events throughout the 20th century, while rounding out with the current political situation in America, but unfortunately Snyder essentially claims that Donald Trump is Hitler, and that is the end and the beginning of his arguments.
