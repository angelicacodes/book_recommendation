Initially, therapy seems to do a lot of good for Tate. She’s forced to start talking about her issues with eating and sex, and the therapist (Dr. Rosen) helps her give voice to issues long left unspoken.

But as we go along, the therapist’s instructions and his role in the author’s life grows, especially as he suggests that she join additional"

I want to start this review off by saying that I don't think traditional forms of therapy are for everyone. I've tried going to therapy and I've tried taking anxiety medication and neither were for me. That does not mean that those things won't work for someone else. Mental health treatment is not a one size fits all type of thing.

Dale Johnson,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108685458-dale-johnson,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50997978-culture-warlords,Cultural Warlords excels when Lavin's exploration into these dark enclaves of depravity is showcased. Her first hand accounts are spine-chilling. I was also pleasantly surprised on how optimistic the book ended. Definitely worth a read.

I've never read from the perspective of a modern-day leftist and hearing her explain the leftist/anti-fascist movement was fascinating and a really important thing to read.

Lara Parker takes a private subject and makes it approachable, relatable, and best of all - funny. As the title suggests, this book is about the female anatomy. But it is more than that.. it is about what we are afraid to talk about and what we are not sure about.

I really admire Parker for this book she wrote. She wrote this novel with confidence and zest.

A book for every woman."
Sian Thomas,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91907139-sian-thomas,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50542443-vagina-problems,"I loved this book. As someone who suffers from some of the same illnesses as Lara, this book really resonated with me. I found myself crying at times and laughing at others as she recounts her experiences that are oh so familiar to me. This book made me feel seen and I hope it will do the same for many others experiencing similar issues. It’s refreshing to read from lived experiences rather than just medical facts. This book will help anyone with similar illnesses feel less alone."
Vernesa Podrimaj,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91751571-vernesa-podrimaj,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50542443-vagina-problems,"Everyone should read it, the main reason why I do recommend it, it’s to understand what people might go through and the way we give feedback to them, it’s an education for everyone that bumps up with negative feedback and makes us feel like we don’t belong and make us feel like we should not have open up. But also it’s a topic that hardly ever it’s discusses! It was my first time hearing about endometriosis. Might sound maybe as ignorance but yes this was my first time hearing about it."
Patricia Baker,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11220424-patricia-baker,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50542443-vagina-problems,kindness thoughts to this author and others who suffer similar symptoms. feel the medical problem solvers should work to help solve those with this. did feel the book was repetitive in that it went over the same painful thoughts/episodes in all chapters. hopefully there will be some research work done in this area.
Antoinette,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102088075-antoinette,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50542443-vagina-problems,"A wonderful book that was more autobiographical than I expected. I have many chronically ill friends, and now I think my understanding of what they go through in their day to day life has been deepened. And I'm always for a book that calls out the western medical industry on their bullsh!t. I received an ARC from a goodreads giveaway."
Deanna,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/417688-deanna,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50542443-vagina-problems,"Disclaimer: I received this book from Netgally for review purposes.

Okay, this book was too good. I feel like she was speaking for me and telling stories of my own experiences. I'd never felt more seen, especially when she told all the stories about doctors not listening, not caring, and overall just giving us sad excuses and results. It hurts. When she talked about trying to date with her problems, or travel, or when she wondered what her life would be like when she wasn't sick - not to mention"
Heather,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82551252-heather,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50542443-vagina-problems,"4.5-stars!!

This giveaway was a dose of honesty that would be wonderful to see more people not turning away from but being open and unashamed to not only speak of but to listen to, to discuss. Ms. Parker provides great incite into a topic I not only wanted to learn more facts on but wanted to hear how such things personally effected another. Wonderful read."
Jennifer Coffey,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33008436-jennifer-coffey,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50542443-vagina-problems,"I really needed to read this book. Lara’s story is heartbreaking and I could relate to her on so many levels.

I thought the writing was fantastic and full of great information. Her voice is strong and full of confidence.

I highly recommend this to any women, especially those that have had some type of problem with their vagina."
Kate,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/85717989-kate,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50542443-vagina-problems,5 stars! This book made me feel so seen and valid. I feel so lucky to be a young woman at a time when books like these (and people like Lara Parker) are around. I hope medicine continues to advance to help with specifically female issues and that topics like these become more commonly talked about.
Melissa,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/312880-melissa,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50542443-vagina-problems,"As a memoir, it's very good. It's not an easy topic to write about in such an open way but she does it so well.

But I feel like this could have had more science reporting - maybe about current studies into endometriosis, etc. (or lack thereof, because patriarchy) or some interviews with others who have had similar experiences. But like I said, it's a very good personal memoir."
Marsha,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1985662-marsha,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50542443-vagina-problems,"I found this book to be so helpful and thoughtful to those of us who suffer (often silently) through these kinds of issues.

Sydney,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6801279-sydney,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50542443-vagina-problems,This book is excellent for feeling someone can empathize with you if you also have vagina problems.

Judy Atwood,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47272910-judy-atwood,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50542443-vagina-problems,"The book was informative regarding vaginal problems that can exist BUT just how one can find enough to write about the subject in this book was individually repetitive, moanful and I repeat, repetitive to the point one could read 1/2 the book and know what to expect in symptoms.

This book is her ""field guide to leading an intentional life.""
But for something claiming to be intentional, this book doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. Instead of inspiring it's all so.....banal....and bland."

This one was disappointing. The premise sounded great - ""opt out"" of the expected paths and find your own way/adventures. She writes the book with ""opting out"" being an analogy to hiking. But, like many reviews said (and I didn't want to believe) it was VERY repetitive and used the same few examples over and over and over. And most of the examples were pretty vague, so it didn't have much impact."

This one didn't hit home with me quite as much. There are some good bits about opting out from ""regular"" life and following the life path that suits you best.

I read her first book and didn’t enjoy it - perhaps it was better for readers who were new to her as an author, but it was more or less a reprint of her blog.

""We all follow our own path in life. At least, that's what we're told.

The author focuses on the idea of it being okay to ""opt out"", choose to live some aspect of your life in a way that's different than others expectations, if it doesn't hurt you or other people. She talks some about her own opt out of having a permanent residence and deciding to travel around Europe for a time but also interviews others who have had their own opt out.

I was looking forward to reading about the experiences of other people and their opt-outs as advertised but I felt she barely scratched the surface either any of them. She indicated in the book that she didn’t think she could finish writing the book due to personal challenges, but hunkered down and did, and it’s shows. The only lesson I really took away was th"

The tagline says it's a field guide and that's exactly how it feels when you're reading. While none of the advice is groundbreaking per se, it does give helpful reminders and encouragement from a friend who feels like a fellow trailblazer.

But. I get what she was trying to do with the hiking analogy format but it didn’t work at ALL for me. I so wanted this to be a memoir and not a how-to guide - she even admitted at the end that all of this big stuff had happened to her during the time period in which the book is set but didn’t discuss it in the book because it didn’t fit the format. I wish an editor had realized how much powerful it could have be

This one is for all those who are drawn to the path less travelled. Follow along as Cait shares some of the paths and experiences she intentionally chose to leave behind, and what she was able to find as a result. A timely reminder that we only get one chance at life and the book provides a guide of sorts for how to navigate leaving the “norm” behind and finding your own way. Highly recommend!"

Flanders shares advice from her life of travel and her pursuit of things that made her feel happy.

While the majority of the novel is travel/hiking based; you don’t have to be either of those things to enjoy it. Opting out is a personal journey, one that takes you on a adventure(much like travel and hiking) with peaks and valleys, learning that even though that fir"

I liked the analogy threaded through the book of hiking and making choices to 'opt out in life.' However Caits examples were not that inspiring or great. One that came up a few times was Cait living in another country but not being able to find accomodations that meet her budget in a few weeks. Would not recommend.

I am glad I did, too. It was a fabulous accounting of the Great Fire. It is such a detailed writing of this huge event in the history of Chicago. The pictures, along with the maps, are fantastic. It helps to see how huge this was in Chicago. It was very well written and really kept my attention. I loved it. I highly recommend this book!"

This book gave a great retelling of Lincoln and his relationship with the press. It read like a novel, so it would be good for even a casual reader of history to pick up. This isn't a story that's often told, so history buffs would love it too. Even though these events happened 150 years ago, Mitchell's writing makes this seem timely and relevant. I would recommend it to anyone who asks."

I was a follower of her blog, which is also the title of her first book (Hyperbole and a Half) and loved her work. But then she practically disappeared right when her book became a best seller. It was strange and worrying. This second book explains a lot about why she seemingly fell off the face of the earth for years, and well, it's not a humorous story unfortunately for her. And it's also a little unfortunate for the re"

We’re all fucking weird. Brosh’s illustrations are so delightfully awkward ... and grasshopper-like? 🤔 They make me giggle. Love her writing style, too.

It really does reflect the way my own angsty thoughts have developed from utterly self absorbed to the begrudging recognition that the rest of the world is also worth payi"

Yes, I've been reading a bunch of graphic novels/manga (I have a huge backlog of titles to log here—and the longer I put them off, the worse it gets), but nothing that's, like, a novel or anything.

All that changed late last week when a friend shared a link to Allie Brosh's blog (hyperboleandahalf, of course) where there was an update about a new book. I started crying.

I know it’s probably hard to believe, especially since there is a Momofuku restaurant in Los Angeles (though to my defense, it’s in the downtown area, which is far from where I actually live) and from what I understand (after the fact, of course), Chang is “prolific” enough to have his own Netflix show, podcast, as well a bestselling cookbook (which me"

Yes, hard work and determination were factors, but Chang readily ad"

Solveig,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/87796513-solveig,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51700803-eat-a-peach,"I would say that I’ve watched all of the Netflix content with David Chang so I expected a funny, light-weight book. I am so glad it’s so much more than that!

As previous reviewers mention, Chang dives deep into his own demons and talks in-depth about his struggles with mental health. I appreciate that he neither tries to sugar-coat his thoughts nor make excuses or try to gain sympathy from the reader. A lot of his stories hit a personal note with me.

Favorite quote: “My answer is no, I don’t think"

It's an easy, well written read by a very interesting person. It's packed with behind the scenes details and drama about the food, the shows, his famous chef friends and his family.

Underneath, he's a boiling inferno of anger trying to outrun imposter syndrome and mental illness.

I loved Momofoku. I never did get into the original restaurant, though did get to Milk Bar. It was one of those books that give me inspiration to cook. This book, not so much.

Finding redemption for past personal failures requires a clear reckoning and Chang airs his shortcomings without flinching or ignoring the harm to others.

I really didn't know anything about Chang and I've never eaten at a Momofuku restaurant (though I totally would; now I'm curious). On one hand, Chang sounds like a *raging a-hole*. But he also is someone who has done a lot of therapy and is aware of it and trying to do better. Being a celebrity chef is a totally bonkers life.

David Chang's memoir is pretty fascinating- hearing the creative processes behind the creation of the numerous restaurants and concepts under the Momofuku umbrella is pretty wild. Chang is honest about the things that failed and why as well as his successes. It's also honest about his mental health and the role that's played in his career. I didn't realize how far this brand had spread until reading this.

I’m not sure what made me choose this one since I don’t follow the author and knew little about him prior to reading it, but something about him being at the top of his career game and still struggling with mental health intrigued me.

David Chang's memoir is successful in all this - it's funny, self-deprecating, proud, shameful and kindhearted. I was only marginally aware of his personality, having only been a fan of cake truffles from Milk Bar and possessing of the Lucky Peach cookbook, but I enjoy his philosophy in the kitchen and look forward to seeing what he comes up with next."

Along with Chang's perspective of how he got to where he is today, he touches on many social and mental health issues (sometimes, successfully; sometimes, with the truths of being {like us all} a flawed human). The closing with the worst case / best case scenarios for what the world of food (and beyond) will be in 2035 is really an artful summation of it all."

I appreciate how truthful the experience of working in one (noisy, cruel/abusive staff and managers, internal politics, evolving to stay alive, etc).

His personal life, career, leadership, mental health journey, leadership methods and and approach to cooking are all explored in this book which, unsurprisingly from Chang, makes this book difficult to categorize. I'm sure it's been through 1000 edits but it reads like journal/stream of consciousness. His voice challenges the status-quo and I hope more books like this come from Chang down the road."

Perhaps because I also suffer from the twin maladies of mental health issues and restaurant ownership. Chang is extremely honest and sincere throughout.

My knowledge of Chang was entirely based on Ugly Delicious and Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner and probably some other food shows. From this perspective, he just seemed like an interesting and smart person who thought about food in a cool way. I feel the same way even more so after reading this.

Lots of name dropping and food details I’m less interested in. I definitely got a view of the stressful restaurant industry but it doesn’t make me feel good that he’s a self admitting raging jerk.

As he preaches in his book, Chang is intent on always molting like a lobster, shedding his skin, changing, and growing. He does this in food, but in this memoir he applies the same approach to his life.

Multiple times she was written off by those pursuing Soviet spies because she was ""just a housewife"" and it was thought that she could not be or do more than that.

M15 agent Milicent Bagot would have bagged Sonya but the boys upstairs underestimated both women. Sonya’s journals are a primary source for McIntyre’s thoroughly researched true spy story. Photos of all the major players are an added bonus.
Ketki Bedekar,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74739691-ketki-bedekar,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"The author did a good job of keeping the reader engaged throughout the storyline. However some parts I found the vital information missing probably due to some reasons. Some parts of the story line repeated itself. Over all our makes the reader interested in many theories such as communism and the communist regime in USSR.
The aftermath of WW2 on various European countries.
Overall - I would recommend this book to be read atleast once."
Fred,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62766091-fred,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"It is truly unbelievable that this person taking the name of Sonya did so much harm for the sake of a belief. This incredibly well written book exposes the world of spying, of which I was clueless. I sometimes had a hard time keeping up with all those names (!) and had to reread to get them to understand who was who. The included photos are quite interesting, the writing style excellent and I would highly recommend it to all."
John Gribbin,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22224713-john-gribbin,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"This could be Ben Macintyre's best book. The story of the most successful spy of the twentieth century (possibly of all time), spanning the rise of Hitler, the communist revolution in China, and the beginning of the Cold War. ""Sonya"" combined her highly dangerous undercover work with being a wife (more than once) and mother, escaping capture by the narrowest margin on several occasions. If you know Macintyre's books, you will love it; if you don't, this is a good place to start."
Barbara,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41675294-barbara,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"I have just finished reading Macintyre's ""Spy Among Friends"" and, as always, totally engrossing. As much as the Philby book was amazing, everyone who has read anything about WWII spies knows about him and his incredible activities. I had never heard about Ursula Kaczynski and am still overwhelmed by her. Macintyre's research and the depth of his knowledge is outstanding but combine that with his writing style make it great reading!"
Mary,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51575454-mary,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"After having read several other books by Ben Macintyre, I was really looking forward to this one, only to be disappointed. A chart or, perhaps, a scorecard, outlining all of the persons involved, together with their various aliases, might have helped. As it was they all blurred together. I grimly saw the story through to the end, each page increasing my dislike for ""Sonya,"" the despicable central figure of the book."
Judi Fine,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51689783-judi-fine,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"I absolutely loved this book. It read like a thriller and had my attention from start to the Acknowledgments. I was intrigued with this spy who Macintyre paints with some admiration and fondness. I found myself liking and admiring Ursula and wishing for a good outcome to her astonishing life. This book is well written and reads like an espionage novel.

I intend to read more of Ben Macintyre's books and do some further reading on Ursula Kuczynski and her family."
Susan,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12781210-susan,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"This is a fascinating book about a German Jewish woman who was a Soviet spy, working/living in China, Poland, Switzerland, Britain before and during WW II. She was smart and - as a woman - was often assumed to be less powerful than the men in her life, though she was their superior in the world of spying. And all the while, managed to raise three children and run a household. This is a very interesting book, a lot about China before the War and the actual life of an underground agent."
Dana Kaplan,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54095238-dana-kaplan,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"Big fan of Ben, but this is not up to his usual. Maybe it’s due to the fact that the spy in question, who undoubtedly had a significant impact, was basically boring. Nothing like Zig Zag or Philby or any of the weirdos in Double Cross. No cliffhangers. Interesting insight into young zealots and true believers. Also more evidence of ineptitude at MI5, when it comes to white, well behaved individuals."
Tony Artman,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40580503-tony-artman,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"Quite brilliant a book you cannot put down. Cast list includes Klaus Fuchs (incidentally interned in the Isle of Man at the same time as my father zl) Roger Hollis, Kim Philby to name the main contemporaries. A beautiful perceptive biography of a disturbed but sincere traitor who should have been picked up by British Intelligence."
Justine,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/117023070-justine,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"A fascinating story. Sadly depressing though in the knowledge that the reason she got away with it for her entire career as a spy was that the men at organisations like MI5 and the FBI continually dismissed her as a potential agent because she was, in their eyes, simply a housewife. The KGB were very smart to recruit women like her."
Peter,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77475728-peter,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"I have always enjoyed MacIntyre's books on spies, and believed them to be relatively accurate. However, in this book Agent Sonya, in Switzerland in 1938, listens to the BBC ""on her transistor radio."" The transistor wasn't invented until 1947, and its use in radios didn't happen until the 1950s. Sloppy writing and editing! Makes me suspicious of other details."
Melissa MacKenzie,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7216559-melissa-mackenzie,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"Ben Macintyre has once again proven that he's among the best historian and writer of the espionage and history. His latest book featuring the story and life of one of the greatest female spies in World history, the woman who pretty much kicked off the Cold War is well informative, fascinating and brilliantly written."
Ben Puritz,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109324661-ben-puritz,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"Another great spy narrative by Ben Macintyre. He effortlessly weaves the intricacies of espionage, idealism, and personal relationships into the pertinent historical settings that both inform and entertain the reader along the way. If you liked The Spy and the Traitor, you'll surely enjoy Agent Sonya."
Debbie Wiseman,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51832168-debbie-wiseman,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"Interesting history of a true believer in the Communist Era.
Agent Sonya was extremely competent and was able to pass all the preparatory formulas and active work on the initial atomic bomb to Russia as it was happening. The USSR was never really behind the USA/United Kingdom in bomb development as a result."
Brandon Forsyth,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19133785-brandon-forsyth,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"Ben Macintyre has done it again! I’ll officially follow this author anywhere, this is not just one of my favourite books of the year but potentially one of my favourites of all time. Ursula Kuczynski lived an incredible life, and le Carré’s maxim about spies being the reflection of their country’s soul has never been truer. Highly, highly recommended."
North Landesman,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32855293-north-landesman,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"Macintyre might be my favorite active storyteller. He takes non-fiction, weaves incredible, entertaining and gripping stories. I always learn something new and have fun reading his books. Agent Sonya provided the female perspective of the spy world. The story of a woman trying to balance raising three kids, multiple secret lovers, and a full time job as a Soviet spy."
David Tovey,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16297926-david-tovey,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,Ben Macintyre has written many excellent tales of extraordinary characters doing amazing things to protect or in some cases to threaten their countries during war and peacetime. None of the characters described so far have been a patch on Ursula Kuczynski: mother and spy. If you are even remotely interested in reading real life spy stories you will love this book.
Reader Variety,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44021795-reader-variety,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"Remarkable story but did not finish it - too much minor personal detail about the participants that proved unimportant to the underlying political and military activities going on around the world at the time. While I understand that Macintyre wants to provide the human dimension and record each thought the participants had at the time, the method grows wearying."
Darren Hardesty,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94255685-darren-hardesty,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"Fantastic book. It is interesting and so readable and what an amazing woman - love or hate he politics she was an incredible woman. This is the first book i have read by Ben Macintyre but i am already looking for more, his narration is also fantastic."
Anna,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17530462-anna,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,Yet another of Ben Macintyre’s books I absolutely loved. Thrilling true story of a spy who was underestimated again and again because she was a woman. But she changed the course of history! Wow. (Bought this immediately for my mom for her birthday!)
victor harris,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5005999-victor-harris,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,I enjoyed his previous work but thought this one got too sidetracked from central theme by numerous sidebars into multiple characters. The individual parts didn't hold together to create compelling reading momentum and narrative unity.
Edward L,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32648438-edward-l,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"My Review

This book has to be the ultimate spy story especially because it about a woman, a wife and a mother. It is almost unbelievable that a women could accomplish so much as a spy when most successful spies were men."
T,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7336773-t,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya,"The story of a self-made ""career woman"" ,albeit for the other side, way before it was usual. Sonya had it all including travel, adventure, job flexibility, and multiple partners. Quite the life story."

In Carry, Jensen often breaks definitions down for us like ""to worry"" as a form of both choking/tearing something slowly and to be distressed and anxious. She is so crafty with her parallels. She is cognizant of the words she is using, writing that she is aware of the connotations of 'boy' and 'man' when it comes to Black victims of violent crimes, for instance. Because language matters.

This is not really a memoir it is more of a series of essays tangentially about violence with no real clear through line. I'm sure people will love this and I definitely respect the author for her openness, but this was not for me.

Toni Jensen’s CARRY: A MEMOIR OF SURVIVAL ON STOLEN LAND is such an occasion.

I’m not saying that a good memoir of grievances is impossible, just that it’s difficult and requires equanimity and latitude that are utterly lacking in Jensen’s book, which is further marred by borderline misandry and a number of tiresome authori"

Jensen has explored, in a thought provoking way, what is means to be Metis and what it means to be female. And, what guns mean in society today. She has used entwined her family history with a stern look at stereotypes. While it's a very serious collection, it is leavened with occasional flashes of light. Thanks to Netgalley for the ARC.

Toni Jensen's memoir is poignant, strong, straight forward and scary as hell. This book covers, the strength of women who face violence in their everyday lives. The strength of women who have children that need to be protected. The strength of women who make hard choices. ""Our America"", has serious issues concerning guns, and Ms. Jensen is not afraid to address the issue. So... where DO we go from here?"
Jean,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7323865-jean,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50640953-carry,"Carry is a memoir in the form of essays. It is beautifully written, although the style might not work for everyone, but I found the writing to be gorgeous and haunting. The essays are all about violence in some form or another, focusing on domestic and gun violence in particular. Reading it is heartbreaking, but also brings to light a conversation we as a nation need to be having.

Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for an advance copy of this book."

Eric,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1435308-eric,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50640953-carry,"Carry was a pretty solid read. Jensen covers a lot of ground - mental illness, Native American struggles, midwestern life, gun violence among many, many other topics. Most of the these essays were fantastic, but some seemed to stop the momentum of her narrative a bit. I appreciate the honesty and frankness of her essays and agreed with her sentiments almost all the time. This was quite a thought-provoking read and some of the details contained within will stay with me for awhile, I'm sure."

This phenomenal memoir beautifully and heartbreakingly describes Toni Jensen's experience as an indigenous woman in the United States while also exploring violence in its many forms. It is a well-balanced mix of personal narrative with social commentary that left me with all the feelings. Her thoughtful and intelligent perspectives are presented in writing that is as exquisitely crafted as it is socio-politically astute."

It delves into the intersection of gun violence, the author's ancestry (Native), and contagion theory. However, it is done so very well through stories the author tells regarding her own personal experiences.
I learned quite a bit of interesting information about the Native experience, and in particular the experience of people who are known as métis - half Native peoples.

I think this is the best book I have read of the year. Ms. Barnett’s empathy, love, and compassion for her clients is evident as their stories easily come to life off the pages. I felt the grief, hope, anger, and joy alongside them. It is no surprise how her empowered storytelling led to such success with clemency applications. I had been somewhat familiar with the impact of the “War on Drugs” and mass incarceration, but this opened my eyes to the ou"

I could not praise or recommend this book more than I already have. It is gut-wrenching yet insightful and covers such a necessary topic of prison reform and the injustice of draconian drug laws.

Brittany K. Barnett is a powerful and inspiring woman that has changed the lives of so many people imprisoned by the injustice of racially motivated convictions and she continues on this fight today.

1. She often addresses her children as baby, often in the form of a question, such as: ""Baby? We can do hard things.""

Some of her trains of thought are harder for me to board. Personally I am bothered that so much of what she bases her ideas on are partially digested/explained Scripture.

Glennon Doyle is an activist, speaker, writer and founder of her own philanthropic organization, “Together Rising”, a community focused on raising funds for high-risk women and children.

I think confused in the key word here.

After decades of silence, one of the most moving, haunting but magnificent love stories to come out of the depths of human tragedy is The Tattooist of Auschwitz. This hybrid novel carefully draws the line between a memoir and fiction. Heather Morris’ account of the incredible life of Lale Sokolov, a Slovakian Jewish man who survives Auschwitz-Birkenau, along with the love of his life, is one unforgettable tale of survival and love.

In an against all odds stor"

I felt NOTHING for any of these characters. 5 stars for Lale’s actual life story, 1 star for this"

Quotes:

For a socially anxious person, it is both flattering and disconcerting to be asked into the holy sacrament of best friendship by a total stranger.

There’s a misconception that celebrities must love socializing, because all we ever see them do is get dressed up, go to fancy parties, and wait for people to take their picture. But you can be famous and still be shy, a plain introvert, or even a person with social anxiety. I once read somew"

She's been more or less a part of the pop culture landscape since The Office, which is a long time, and her works are worth reading.

Please Like Me (but keep away) is a very quick read. Yup. That's how I have to start off this review. It was okay-ish. I was loving it, relating and possibly falling in love with Mindy, right before she started sounding like a rich, whiny, spoiled celebrity who can't be bothered with anything that isn't for HER in life. While, I had trouble swallowing some of her selfishness and privilege (that she somehow isn't aware of) , there were many good, relatable quotes and an overall, adorab"

First of all, this title reminds me of her book “Why is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns).”

I don't know how Mindy managed to touch on such deep and personal topics in just one short story, but of course she did it. This story was all about social anxiety and being introverted and lonely in a new city with no friends. It was so relatable and she was able to put all my thoughts into words. It felt like I was listening to my friend talk to me.

My 2nd short book by Mindy Kaling and such an  honest and endearing read. Mindy talks so easily about her not-so-easy-to-deal-with social anxiety, about her struggles as an Indian kid torn between Indian and American cultures (in places silly but definitely not an easy one), about her barometer for making friends, about craving female friendships in a new city but not just women to surround herself to make her feel not alone.

I’m not sure what possessed me to listen to this audiobook. I have ZERO interest in self help books. But once I started, I thought it was good enough to keep going.

The title is there for shock value, but it’s not a particularly shocking book, unless you’re easily put off by swearing. The author is not really advocating that we all drop everything and run to the beach. He’s arguing for recalibrating what matters to you, and acting on it.

The secondary title - “a counterintuitive approach"

I like Manson's straight talking, no BS style. He lays it out for you in simple terms, and then tells you that you need to get over yourself if you want to be happy. That nobody is happy all the time, and that you will always have problems. It just depends on what you choose to worry about th"

It doesn't seem that way. Sure the more you focus in on the details there might be at the level of things that ultimately don't matter.

As a result, Mindy believed that when she became a mom, she'd be independent and do it all like her mother, but a friend advised her that the time after having a baby would be both physicall"

She's been more or less a part of the pop culture landscape since The Office, which is a long time, and her works are worth reading.

The story of Rose is another one in which I want to do a bit of eye rolling, like Mindy did you really not realize that having a South-Asian-descent lady around during the first few months"

Another great piece by Kaling. Laughed out loud at this:

And when it came to a baby, I was not prepared. I had read the baby books, of course, but could remember literally nothing but one fact: “babies are born without kneecaps.” What the hell was I supposed to do with that information? Invite some gangster to take retribution against me by kneecapping my baby and then laugh when he realizes it’s physically impossible? That was no good to me; I would have needed to lay the gr"

I'm giving all 6 essays in this collection the same rating since it *is* a collection. Mindy is a fantastic writer but I mostly found this collection ""meh"". Perhaps it's because there were only 6 so I felt dissatisfied--I don't know. I just didn't feel as connected to her as I did in her previous books. I'd still recommend the collection--it's a fast and light read, and Mindy's writing voice is extremely personable."

I’m happy Mindy used her celebrity status for good: opening up about her journey into motherhood and showing that it’s okay not to be okay. I don’t yet have children of my own but hope to some day, and I can only imagine the constant fear of whether what you’re doing is right, perfect or “normal.” I’m glad Mindy found her own normal."
Fatima,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7089995-fatima,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55056141-help-is-on-the-way,"My favourite one so far out of the collection. I have three more to go!

This was such a sweet, heartwarming essay on her first pregnancy & the relationship she built with her daughter’s nurse, Rose. We also gain some touching insight on Mindy’s relationship with her mother & her fears about motherhood and the apprehension of asking for help.

I will read anything & everything Mindy has to write! Definite 5 stars for this one. Also - that knee quote made me LOL."
Rochelle,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103561793-rochelle,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55056141-help-is-on-the-way,"""Don't complain, don't explain""; it's a quote Mindy's mother lived by.

In this part of the series she talks about her decision to hire a baby nurse and how that plays out for her. It's emotional, comedic, humane. What I liked about this part is that she has humanized a 'celebrity mom'.
She compares how motherhood was for her mother vis-a-vis herself.

She is single, has lost her mother and is somewhat terrified about motherhood. She finds her way eventually. Kudos to her!"

I love Mindy's conversational style and clean writing. This is a wonderful, emotional fast read that touches on a very difficult thing for many people...asking for and accepting help. Mindy shares her thoughts and emotions so openly that it reads like an email or text from a friend rather than a story you downloaded and read first thing before getting out of bed on a Saturday."

This essay, like the others released in this collection, has made me laugh and cry. Mindy Kaling has long been my idol, and her honesty and voice are comforting.

Mindy’s story about life postpartum without her mom really resonated with me. Like everything she writes, it is hilarious and brilliantly written. She describes things in a way that made me feel like I was listening to my friend tell a story. There were also some really touching parts that will stay with me.

I don't know what it is like to be a single mother, but I can imagine from what I've seen friends go through that it is no walk in the park. I'm glad Mindy found someone to help her get through those initial scary times and develop the confidence to rock motherhood!

Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood ~~ Trevor Noah



Trevor Noah's BORN A CRIME is hilarious, heartbreaking & always told through a sympathetic lense. Noah moves from comedy to tragedy seamlessly.

I consider myself an unofficial expert on celebrity memoirs.

In BORN A CRIME, Trevor Noah takes that arc, flattens it out, and beats you over the head with it.

Trevor Noah, a comedian and the current host of 'The Daily Show' is a very funny guy.....and I expected this memoir to be full of witty jokes. It's not. The book is about Trevor growing up in South Africa when apartheid was coming to an end. Apartheid and it's aftermath left the impoverished black population of South Africa with hard lives and few opportunities. Nevertheless, Trevor infuses his story with hope and humor.

This book was hilarious and sad and full of South African history during the apartheid. I really appreciate Noah writing it. I appreciate his optimistic look at life.

In a word: Indescribable

There really are no words that can do justice to this incredible autobiography. I listened to this book on Audible narrated by the author, and I highly recommend this version; Trevor Noah is multi-lingual, and if I had to try to read/sound out some of the words in Xhosa, Zulu, and Afrikaans in the print version, I'm certain that I would not come anywhere close! Also, to hear the experiences from the person to whom they occurred makes it all the more meaningful."

- ""You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.""

James Clear explains how and why habits are formed, and gives steps to follow for breaking bad habits and establishing productive ones. He points out that “You do not rise to the level of your goals; you fall to the level of your systems.” He then encourages the reader that it is really a simple two-step process:

A powerful thought in Atomic Habits, except of all the great examples of how to create and maintain good habits - is the fact that many very small habits will compound over time and give great effect and results.

1. Make it obvious.
2. The environment matters.
3. Create barriers for the stuff you don’t want to do automatically and expose and make it easier to do the things you want to do. For example, if you want to eat less sweets and more healthy, hide the sweets and put a bowl of"

I finished listening to Atomic Habits a few days ago and I am inspired. Most certainly inspired to make a schedule and start a simple goal journal.

On the surface, some of the ideas are simple, but James Clear gives you ideas on how to start and successfully build good habits. His website even offers many worksheets to help you on your road to building successful habits. Google search ATOMIC HABITS WORKSHEET FREE.

He is writing these essays as a series of lessons for his teenage son. He speaks of the dangers that confront a black youth from every side. I struggled with his opinion that the schools were as much a danger as the gangs. These essays are purely his opinion. He cites specific events bu

First of all, with his previous books, the main argument has been very clear. But ‘Talking with Strangers’ is directionless and, at times, confusing. I didn’t even know what he meant by “strangers” as his definition seemed to keep changing. And I found myself wondering what his point was on more than one occasion.

Humans are ill-equipped to understand strangers. We assume that people tell the truth, so we can’t detect lies.

The result of this misplaced confidence is that we don’t invest enough time and patience in truly listening to a"

“There are clues to making sense of a stranger. But attending to them requires care and attention. We should accept the limits of our ability to decipher strangers.”

Talking To Strangers is the sixth book by British author, Malcolm Gladwell. Is it a book about social interaction? Yes, certainly, but not so much a “how to” as a “why do we get it wrong”. Gladwell explores the reasons that we seem to be so bad at telling when strangers are lying to us. He does this with reference to a myriad of"

Sometimes you read a book so powerful and so important that you wish everybody would read it. So You Want to Talk About Race is one of those books. I highlighted so many sentences and entire paragraphs that I'm glad it's a Kindle version and not a print book. It is such a compelling and thought-provoking read and I learned a g"

I am so glad I finally got around to reading this book this month, I listened to the audiobook and I feel like that is the best way to consume this book. Ijeoma Oluo has such an incredible way with words and this book is very powerful and reminds me how much words matter. This isn't my first anti-ra"

The book should be read by everyone but is especially useful for white people who want to try to avoid making mistakes in getting active and to especially realize blind spots that could stay undetected.

Ta-Nehisi Coates' Between the World and Me is a timeless book. Then there is another category of books I would call “books for our time.” And Between the World and Me is that kind of book too.

But consider Ijeoma Oluo’s So You Want to Talk About Race. It is definitely a book for our time, yet I doubt many people—me included—would ever consider it a timeless book. Yet paradoxically, Oluo’s book may be an even more important book for certain people to read than any of Mr."

I was engaged. I loved the writing, the well-formulated arguments, and especially the focus on everyday micro-aggression. Intersectionality is pretty obvious.

So is the institutional racism.

It's not a trigger word. It's a fact.

Add this to soooo0 many small things in our everyday lives whether in conversation or news or even in our own assumptions DESPITE our best intentions, and we will be forced to realize that the institution is within us all.

Most compelling is Oluo’s discussion of the damage caused by ‘everyday racism,’ the kind of racist attitudes or behavior that many don’t think really matters. What one person might see as small inconsequential actions have the cumulative weight of life experience. Words and behavior matter. Everyday racism also feeds into an acceptance of the system"

I loved this book. I finished it in a day simply devouring Oluo’s word. I can relate to so much of what Oluo was sharing and in so many ways it was validating but also depressing.

Unlike many other scholarly works on race, this book uses language that is accessible and could even be used in an AP Language course. Actually, it would probably be a great addition to an AP Language course.

The feelings it brings up in us are justified. But it is also everywhere, in every corner of our lives. We have to let go of some of that fear. We have to be able to look racism in the eye wherever we encounter it. If we continue to treat racism like it is a giant monster that is chasing us, we will be forever running. But running won’t help when it’s in our workplace, our government, our homes, and ourselves. I am so gl"

I think the book was simple and straight to the point in its approach and easily understandable. Ijeoma gave some helpful guidance on how to broach conversations on race in a more healthy and productive way. She literally put bullet points on how to address certain situations. In my opinion, more non-black/non-POC need to read this book.

How do you know if something is about race? Oluo's answer: It is about race if a person of color thinks it's about race.

By incorrectly labeling the cause of a problem, you risk exacerbating the problem. (Thomas Sowell has several great books on this topic).

This books holds up a mirror to all discomfort when it comes to race in the most educational way possible. I highly recommend everyone read this.
First of all, the book is divided into chapters, each dealing with a different topic of racism.

I know many people feel that this is more like a life altering book for them. But that's truly not the same in my case.

1. The book is more like hardcore history which has never been my choice of subject

Anne Frank was a German girl born on June 12, 1929. She was originally from Germany but since her, as well as the rest of the family, were Jewish, they had to move to Amsterdam, Holland, in 1933. For those of you who don’t know, a Jewish person is someone who was born of a Jewish mother or someone converted to Judaism.

Right now, it's very popular to be an introvert.

SUMMARY
At least one-third to one-half of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking, reading to socializing, and working on their own to working in teams. Many of society’s great contributors are introverts: Rosa Parks, Gandhi, Chopin, Theo Geisel, Warren Buffett, Steve Wozniak and Eleanor Rosevelt. In QUIET, Susan Cain argues that we dramatic"

Evolution, as a method, not a theory
Evolution is mainly regarded as a theory, for explaining a phenomenon such as the survival of a species over another one, which means an epistemological approach towards understanding the reality. However, evolution can be used as a ""method"" for describing different phenomena around us; a neo-Darwinian approach which counts on evolution as a methodology of study, rather than a theory. Such a perspective is becoming popular very rapidly, especia"

I understood now: I could stand with my family, or with the gentiles, on the one side or the other, but there was no foothold in between.

This book is a memoir of the growing up of Tara Westover. The book is split into three parts: growing up and her childhood; College, predominantly at BYU; and, further education and the cracking of familial relationships. This book, I found, was largely an exploration of her familial relationships and the empowerment of education.

It’s a very interesting and entertaining read, I was absolutely fascinated, even more so because it’s a true story. My only minor complaint is that I wanted more murder amongst the madness and mayhem. I wanted the nitty gritty details of the murders on the same level we got details of the fair. It was an excellent read nonetheless and I would absolutely recommend it!"

Larson deserves five stars for research ALONE. Gah. Coupled with his own skill at fleshing everything out so that it reads like a thriller novel is bonus, because this book was so easy to fall into.

too tedious,

It would be a sham if I said I wasn't pleased with this book's content (sitting here and thinking it's not because I'm dumb, it's because that's the fate I was given).

Witty, funny and cautiously candid, Tina Fey's book is an interesting read. What made the book click,more than the Liz Lemon persona, is the very average human approach towards success. Self deprecatory jokes are not in the recipe for autobiography.

I had previously heard the story of Chris McCandless and his journey into the Alaskan wilderness. My initial fascination was with the subsequent people that followed Chris to see his final resting place at Bus #142 and their equally fatal results.
After reading the book, Chris has become less of a sad footnote, and more of a real person with thoughts and feelings who made some major decisions about how he wanted to live his life that most of us wouldn't dare to attempt.

Well, if like most people you find textbooks mind-numbingly dull or haven’t read a science book since high school, you probably would not do what Bill Bryson did. He has taken it upon himself to basically teach himself about these subjects, and then write an entire book in an approachable and humorous style that will keep you entertained and…wait for it…actually interested in scie"

How could he have known he was publishing a book about social media on the eve of social media’s inchoate move into our social DeoxyriboNucleicAcid, or that the overgrowth of soci"

Gladwell defines a tipping point as ""the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point"". The book seeks to explain and describe the ""mysterious"" sociological changes that mark everyday life. As Gladwell states: ""Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread like viruses do"".

The underlying idea is to recognise the signs of judgement's fragility, and accept the fact that we end up making snap judgements all of the time. Although intuitive judgements are very valuable in high-stress real world situations, it is important to be aware of our own limitations. We are not aware of so many things, and yet we don't feel ignorant!

Such a great, quick, easy read. Gladwell’s books always leave me feeling positive and eager to better myself.

Loved the opening anecdote about the kouros as well as learning about Paul Van Riper and the Blue Team and Abbie Conant’s confrontation with the Munich Philharmonic.

Gladwell’s idea that criminals shouldn’t actually be in the courtroom is interesting and worth us investigating further. Trials where race, gender and age are not presented to the jury may go a along way in fixing"
