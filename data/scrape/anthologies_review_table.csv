Those who love to read Neil Gaiman, and those who haven't discovered him...yet.

OK, I exaggerate. But Neil is so crafty, so clever, so careful with language, that there's probably something for everyone. I'm not wild about everything he has written, but I can always admire how he does it.

This compendium has 47 short stories and short excerpts (10 pages or so) from his novels. A couple of the stories tie into his novel ‚ÄúAmerican Gods‚Äù and one ties to ‚ÄúN"

Well, this was not what I expected. I was going into this book thinking it was more like The Language of Thorns (one of the best books Leigh has written, the short stories are truly amazing). But then I held the book and it was like 100 pages long and each story was barely two pages long.

When I saw this book was coming out I was excited to read about the saints that had made up some of the belief system in Grishaverse.

The art work is stunning don't get me wrong, but the stories meh! It's like a camp fire story time. The stories are short and don't really have much depth, if I compare to the language of thorns which was a collection of grishaverse short stories, language of thorns would win."

I should have known based on her last short story book that these stories were designed to expand the world and not provide any content. I was thinking it was going to be more like The Assassin's Blade.

It's not bad but I didn't like the writing style; it read like a children's book of Bible stories. This is a personal preference-you might like it."

As a collection of stories, there isn't much to go on. They read like someone has transcribed oral renditions of local stories. An interesting and significant stylistic choice, but leads to very little content for many of the named Sankts."

What a great way to live a little bit of history. Each story handles the October 12, 1915 suffrage parade from a different angle, through a different character's eyes--young, old, men, women, women of color. As you go deeper into the collection the kaleidoscope view copes into focus. You see how much the suffrage movement accomplished, and how much more it had to accomplish. There is something for everyone here."

It's a collection of short stories that are woven together in a really clever way. Especially important to read during election year. As you think about your ballot and stand in line to make your decisions known, it's interesting to think of the women of long ago who went before and paved the way to make it possible for us to vote today. This book brings those women and their viewpoints to life. Recommended."

These stories are filled with such foreboding that I had to put the book down on multiple occasions. I found myself wanting to yell at each protagonist as their situations worsened. To tell them to beware. To tell them to hide, to run, to wake up. Very real and surreal at the same time.

Joyce Carol Oates has such a distinctive style, that the reader knows it‚Äôs her from the get-go. In the same way that it‚Äôs possible to identify some singers on any of their cuts from the first few bars, it‚Äôs possible to identify Oates from the cadence and tone of her writing from the first few sentences. She is at her best in short pieces, where the style doesn‚Äôt have time to feel repetitive, so this book of four novellas is a perfect showcase of her writing. Listening to this, at"

While all four stories have elements that initially seem a little unreal, or a little trippy, the threats faced by the narrators are very real.

Mia Dao - story about a girl and a feral cat - this was my favorite.

Phantomwise: 1972 - pedophile undertones that I didn‚Äôt like at all.

The Surviving Child - good creepy story.

Not my favorite by JCO but I did enjoy the read.

So this little treasure collection of four novellas satisfies that need in me. Once I‚Äôve finished the first, there are three more to devour! Oates is masterful at keeping one guessing. So skilled, never obvious, always surprising. This is a wonderful and satisfying read‚Äîa place to escape the real horror that is going on in our world, allowing me to hide out in fiction/mystery. And now I‚Äôm off to read more Joyce Carol Oa"

Her descriptions and characterizations are superb. These stories are unusual and compelling. My favorite is the title story which evokes a sense of mystery and unease. It felt like an old fashioned gothic mystery. I must admit I was surprised by the ending which, for me, was a 'wait, WHAT?!' moment. I'm still not sure how I felt about it.

The other stories didn't feel quite as 'finished' as the first but they were still enjoyable to read. This bo"

Intensely dark and ultimately depressing, Oates illuminates the trauma of puberty, of loss of parents, of the creeping and leering gaze of males in positions of power, all through the lens of women and girls. Like many of her other works, Oates shows us the world of women and girls and makes us wonder how any of us are so lucky to ge"

Oates latest book will make it hard for the reader to discern between the two. In these four unpublished novellas, Oates demonstrates her mastery at getting into the heads of her characters. I think actual chill went up my spine as I read the stories about women facing danger. This was especially true of ‚ÄúMiao Dao‚Äù in which a lonely young girl befriends a feral cat."

I was really excited to read these short stories and wow, what an experience! The way they were written is unlike anything else I have read. In each story I was sucked in, completely engrossed, and then taken aback abruptly by the ending. This happened four times in a row! I'm so glad I had the opportunity to dive into the twisted worlds she creates."

If you are looking for a chilling read to get in the Halloween mood, I would recommend it. I particularly liked the buildup in the first story, was disturbed by the second one, not particulalry impressed by the third story, and again, blown away by the final and fourth story.

Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for the arc."

After I accepted Oates' apparent definition of 'suspense"" I was ok with the stories if a bit disappointed. What I struggled with was how they featured various women -- Clare, Mia, Alyce, and Elisabeth -- all victims; they were either naive or foolishly lured by the pretense of love, too weak each time. Too often the protagonists went unpunished and the tragedies were seen as ""Not his fault, but hers."""

Her stories, especially her short stories, are so magnificent to read or listen to. While they tend to have just a pinch of supernatural, the truly creepy aspects of her writing bring to life things that happen to so many people, on a daily basis. She is one of the few writers who can make every day things scary, but in such a beautifully written way."

Before To Hold Up the Sky, I had never read Cixin Liu. I wanted to read The Three-Body Problem , but I was so afraid of misunderstanding it that I didn't dare. Then I received this ARC from NetGalley, so I decided to finally dive in.

I enjoyed some of the stories in this collection, but most felt like a chore. I struggled to finish this book, and I'm really sad, cause I'm a huge fan of the Remembrance of Earth's Past series. Part of this could be because I rarely enjoy short story collections (their themes tend to be too varied and the stories too different to really resonate with me). I hoped I'd still like them, cause this is Liu Cixin. But that didn't work out. I'"

To Hold Up the Sky is a collection of short stories written by the one and only, Liu Cixin. As with the rest of her works, these stories dive into a world of science fiction that only Liu Cixin could dream up.

Included in this collection are eleven amazing stories: The Village Teacher, The Time Migration, 2018-04-01, Fire in the Earth, Contraction, Mirror, Ode to Joy, Full-Spectrum Barrage Jamming, Sea of Dreams,"

Hold Up the Sky is a collection of sci-fi short stories from Cixin Liu. This is music to my ears because I always enjoyed Mr. Liu's works. As usual, Mr. Liu's stories explores the interface between science, philosophy and the human pathos. However, unlike his other short story collection, The Wandering Earth, which was more accessible by the general public, the stories in Hold UP the Sky are quite steep in science and mathematics as well as more abstract.

The series of stories should be labelled fi-sci instead with the author's loose grasp of science and high regard for his own fantasies and ideas. Whoever published this should honestly have a deep look at themselves and consider their life choices.

I also enjoyed how there was pictures in some of the stores. I enjoyed how most of the stories had the main character, and sometimes others, growing and accepting different things about themselves. Some of the stories were a little more boring than others, but that is probably just a personal preference. This boo"

They are varied, many are LBTGQ affirming, and at least one should spark a sense of commonality or recognition with anyone who grew up or is growing up in rural America. My favorite is Joseph Bruchac's 'Pull Up A Seat Around the Stove.' It's not only a love story about an earlier era, but a message to younger people that their parents and grandparents can be treasures of reminiscence that"

Rural Voices: 15 Authors Challenge Assumptions About Small-Town America edited by Nora Shalaway Carpenter was one of my highly anticipated books of the month.

3.5 stars

This story felt like a mixture of different fairytales, with Elle, a half-human/half-fae princess at the centre. Her father, the King, wants nothing to do with her, and prefers to have her locked away, but Elle gets sick of her prison and decides she needs to escape.

This story felt like a mixture of different fairytales, with Elle, a half-human/half-fae princess at the centre. Her father, the King, wants nothing to do with her, and prefers to have her locked away, but Elle gets sick of her prison and decides she needs to escape.

A teenager finds that a dead friend's cell phone, that was buried with the body, still communicates from beyond the grave.

This was a very sweet story. King is so good at writing from the viewpoint of kids. This story covers over a decade so he not only has to capture the kid's voice, but then the grown man's. He does both beautifully.

In the Author's Notes King says this is his ode to a mix"

The first two stories in this collection are strong with plenty of that good ol' SK magic.

This isn't going to be a long review, but it was an average collection. I've never been a huge fan of King's short stories. They always leave me wanting more. I prefer his novels. But, if this had just been the titular story, I would be rating it much higher.

Mr. Harrigan‚Äôs Phone: It was good, but a bit average. I liked the story but I still would have liked more in the end. 4/5

I think I might prefer short stories over large tomes by Stephen King. They save me from reading a 1000+ page novel, with 50 different side characters that end up dying anyway. Because these were short stories some where better than others, in my opinion. The first one felt like classic, creepy King. The second was pretty unique in both format (jumping timelines to tell a backstory) and storyline. The third was a Holly Gibney story, and shared the title of the book. The forth did have some Sh"

This story asks these questions, and more. Someone, doing vigilante justice, is surely going against the country's established laws?

Listen, I love the GrishaVerse so much. It's one of my favourite high fantasy worlds, and you can tell Leigh Bardugo loves it so much herself and has put so much work into it. The Grisha world just keeps on expanding and every expansion really makes me heart sing. This world is a little twisted, a little creepy, a little shattered. Filled with broken people and stories, with creepy histories and dangerous characters and a chilling aesthetic."

The Language of Thorns is a collection of six stories and novelettes by Leigh Bardugo, dark and lyrical folk tales set in her GRISHA universe, in the Russian-inspired country of Ravka and other nearby countries. These are stand-alone stories, unrelated to the specific characters and events in the GRISHA novels. This tales might be told on a dark night by a villager living in Ravka.

They were even better the second time around, and the new stories were magical as well. You can see which classic fairy tales inspired some of these stories, but they all have the"

""In the year that summer stayed too long, the heat lay upon the prairie with the weight of a corpse.""


Can we please talk about what a goddamn gift of a writer Leigh is? Beautiful writing, to me, isn't how many constellations you can find in a love interest's freckles, or stringing together a tinsel chain of adjectives, but the ability to reinvent words. Look at that sentence. It captures the fly-buzzing, desolate atmosphere perfectly while lending a new dimension to the word corpse.

The Language of Thorns is comprised of six short stories - 3 of which are old and can be read anywhere on the internet and the other 3 are completely new and never seen before. I guess I wished for more of new material? Only 3 new stories are not enough to comprise a full book, in my opinion.

The Language of Thorns is comprised of six short stories - 3 of which are old and can be read anywhere on the internet and the other 3 are completely new and never seen before. I guess I wished for more of new material? Only 3 new stories are not enough to comprise a full book, in my opinion.

Kindle freebie. I was so excited to get three books for free. That should've been a red flag. I tried, I really did, to get through the first book but I couldn't. The writing was horrible. No descriptions; never made you feel like you were in the book watching these characters. I kept getting confused with the characters and who was actually related instead of family friends.

Great beginning to a series, but with the books not being long enough to be considered something other than a novella-I can't justify paying $4.99 a ""book"". If these were kindle unlimited, then yes I'd consider reading on, but as they are not, I guess I stop here."

The last few chapters I was ready for this story to be done. As I slogged through this, I was left with an end that lead to another book on the future. Suspense was annoying."

While I don't mind an occasional steamy bedroom scene, I prefer a book with an actual plot where the characters are more developed and there is more to the story than just who is hopping into the sack with who... sorry, but I just couldn't get past the first book in the set because it just was too predictable and boring."

I honestly don't know how I could tell anyone to read these books. If you want to spend $100s, yes hundreds, on a series of our 50 books be my guest. However I can't afford that.

I enjoyed this book because it showed the different side of a complicated group of young people trying their best to become adults. It shows them in a good way and sometimes at their worst.

Short stories are not my jam. I recognize this. This book was just not for me.

8 unique, quirky stories empowering women, listing sexual exploits during a pandemic, a retelling of the famous green ribbon story, and a very long summation of Law & Order (which I've not watched). I struggled to really connect to any of these, and now looking back while the writing was strong, not a single one stands out to me now. My mistake might have been listening to this on audio.

Machado explores female desire and sexuality throughout all of the stories in this collection. It's both a celebration of the female body, and an unflinching look at the ways the world debases and abuses the female body. We see lots of women loving women in this book--both lesbian and bi rep!

http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifesty...

In her 1826 essay on the subject of the supernatural in literature, gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe differentiates between the sensations of ""terror"" and ""horror,"" arguing that terror is a feeling of dread that exists before an event has happened, whereas horror is a feeling of revulsion that exists after an event has taken place. Terror, she claims, ""expands the soul and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life"" while"

The Husband Stitch - 4/5
A retelling of an old fable, set in a world where everyone woman has a ribbon somewhere on her person, keeping something secret that is hers alone. It's a story about the demands of the world, and men, for women to give everything of themselves - not in a malicious way, but because they can't bare knowing.

I really enjoyed all the stories, and each was unexpected in their own ways. This is a feminist read and something I could see added to a list of works recommended for fans of Roxanne Gay. From strong and open sexual relations to psychological mysteries, this has various voices with twists that I never knew what to expect. It was open about sex and sexual behavior, which is refreshing.

There's a nice variety in these stories but, taken collectedly, they feel less original, less startling, less innovative than I expected.

The themes of violence perpetrated both against women (The Husband Stitch, Especially Heinous) and by women against themselves (Eight Bites) are important, of course, but these stories never pushed me or challenged me in any way.

This is my first short story collection, and it was certainly an interesting one at that. ""Her Body and Other Parties"" is a very provocative collection, focusing on women's lives & the violence visited upon their bodies. The stories were haunting, visceral and powerful.

I loved getting to see more from some of my favourite characters from the Selection series and getting to know more about how their lives played out after the Selection. I only have two small complaints about this collection. The first being that two of the stories had been in a previous collection so I had already read them. The second being that there was no story about Eadlyn! I would have loved to have had a story about her life and marriage after

I enjoyed the stories here. The Selection series is one of my all time favorite series so this was a real treat.

I would recommend it. Many people who read the three books in The Selection do not even know about this one. One last thought: did NOT enjoy the second series from the daughter's POV . I did not even finish that series."

I've always thought of Kiera Cass's books as addicting, cheesy, and lots of fun. That's why I always come back to them because I know I can finish them in a day and get a couple hours of entertainment out of them.

The Queen was the first novella in the book, and it showed the romatic pairing of Queen Amberly (in her perspective) and King Clarkson.

She is so sweet and naive. As always I still don't like King Clarkson. He's probably the character I hate the most. I'm 100% inlove with Aspen and Maxon. Both of them are so amazing. And of course America - she's so strong and powerfull. Great book. I can't wait to read Eadlyn's story.

I did not realise how much I missed the characters. Especially Maxon. I enjoyed the audiobook where they were multiple narrators. This book makes me want to reread the Selection series.

Honestly, I was confused of the first story. I did not understand who the girl were until the next story. I still liked it except the slapping part, that was just cruel to her.

I liked getting to see the Queen during her Selection days and also seeing the King before he was the douche we know in the series. The Queen was very demure and very much the 'I will do anything my husband asks' type, so I wish she was a little bit stronger, but I understood her and her actions.

Amazing books. The part I liked the most was WHERE ARE THEY NOW? It was nice to know about the elites. I'm glad that Celeste realized that she was wrong and there are other important things in life too. There was a special part about her which I liked the most. I'm happy to see that the others too have moved on and are doing well in life. They all seem to be happy for America and no one holds any grudges.

Cass's ability to jump into the shoes of some our favourite characters and make us love and understand them even more is just delightful.

Not the best collection, honestly, though there are some interesting back stories that aren't something Ito usually supplies, including him reminiscing over his love of horror manga as a kid.

Kelli,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7875498-kelli,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49081449-venus-in-the-blind-spot,"So, this was a great collection.

In this anthology, we have some of the more disturbing stories Junji Ito has written as well as a couple of classic tales from other others that Ito has adapted into manga. Some notable stories included are ‚ÄúBillions Alone‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Human Chair‚Äù, and the truly horrific classic ‚ÄúThe Enigma of Amigara Fault‚Äù. Each of these stories is unnerving in its own distinctively Junji Ito way but when they are all paired together like this, it makes for a frightening collection."

The only one I would is probably ""The Enigma of Amigara Fault,"" since that's one of his most well-known works.

A lot of these stories are also adaptations of other writers' stories rather than Ito's own. They weren't bad or anything, but they do have a"

With 'Venus in the blind spot' he has given us short, gripping, and boundless tales that shows maybe most mainstream horror writers don't know what they are doing.

I really appreciate the little anecdotes Junji Ito includes with some of the stories here. It really shines a light into the lovely personality that many might not assume he has.

I enjoyed most of these horror short stories but mostly the artwork.

Didn't dock any stars for this, but I do wish the coloring had been consistent. Some of the stories began in color and after several pages switched to black and white and that was jarring.

However, I am starting to get the feeling that the author has begun to tire of his main character, Peter, and put less effort into his stories.

I particularly enjoyed the story about the River Wandle and what happens after Peter and Beverley's exploits with the river Lugg but all the stories were great, even the little snippets. My only criticism is that there weren't enough of them to keep me goin"

It's a nice collection of short stories and snippets from various books and more across the wider Rivers series. Some of these were previously only available in certain editions of the Rivers books so it was great to finally get them collected like this.

The audio version is particularly well done though with narration from Alex Kingston Ben Aaronovitch, Ben Elliot, Felix Grainger, Kobna Ho"

As I prefer to get my books from an independent book shop this rather annoyed me. They have been collected now, well at least some of them have, and a fine little collection it is too.
There are appearances from all the major characters, with the stories set in chronological order, with an authors note preceding each one.
It is quite a short collection, only 140 pages so it won't take long"
Miriam,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51492313-miriam,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54289642-tales-from-the-folly,"I had read most of these short stories before, but it was still nice to have them all in one conventient place. And some of them were new to me. I enjoyed all of them very much. I think Aaronovitch often ends the stories a bit abruptly, but once I got used to that it was fine. And I really love any extra bit about Peter and the others from the Rivers of London stories, especially Abigail and Dominic."
Colin Forbes,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8961184-colin-forbes,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54289642-tales-from-the-folly,"An enjoyable collection of short stories in the Rivers of London universe. A few I had encountered previously, but mostly new to me. Nice to have them all brought together in one volume.

One for existing fans of the series, not an entry point for curious readers.

It's good to know that Ben Aaronovitch is still excited to write stories for some of his ancillary characters, but I might prefer it if he focused on the main series of books. I've run out!"
Glenn Johnson,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7269535-glenn-johnson,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54289642-tales-from-the-folly,"Enjoyed a number of these, but I have to say that I did skip over a few, whether because I had already read them or in some cases simply because they didn‚Äôt entirely grab my attention in the way that other books/ stories in the series have. I‚Äôm excited for the Abigail novella (?) though, I really enjoy her and the chance to see from her perspective! Overall, a nice little collection with some standouts and a few minor disappointments. 3.5 stars"

Normally Americans write Brits badly and awkwardly. This is the other way around! As usual, Aaronovitch is funny, and his mysteries are solid. But that was just weird. Also in the ebook I got from the library, the double-fs in the first German chapter were all in a different font, which is a thing I have never seen before. Only that chapter. Very mysterious."
AndrewP,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3590983-andrewp,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54289642-tales-from-the-folly,"I had read a few of these stories before but it was nice to hear them in audiobook form. Kobna Holbrook-Smith reads the Peter Grant stories and and other narrators read the stories that are told from a different viewpoint. Aaronovitch himself narrates a brief introduction to each story which was a bonus. (If you haven't heard him before he sounds just like a character out of one of his own books, London accent and all.)

Good stuff and defiantly a must if you're a Rivers of London fan."
Kenneth,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9020716-kenneth,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54289642-tales-from-the-folly,"Ben Aaronovitch sketches characters and places so deftly, so smoothly, he makes something really hard look easy. His characters feel real, his places are characters themselves. It is, in my opinion, the best urban fantasy around.
This is a collection of short stories, and mostly for the completist, really. If you're caught up on the main series, get it. If not, go back to the beginning and get started."
Sue Gill,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14765668-sue-gill,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54289642-tales-from-the-folly,"Brilliant windows into the world of Peter Grant and other cast members.

Interesting to have some story's lead by secondary characters, you get to hear much more of thier individual voice."

Now I am not a short story fan, however this is Rivers of London short stories so it‚Äôs a totally different ball game. These are fun and yes leave you wanting more. I want to read The October man novella now I have met some of the characters. Great stuff. Aaronivitch doesn‚Äôt disappoint."
Amelie,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25632043-amelie,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54289642-tales-from-the-folly,"Some authors cram wonderful plots full clue trails and twists into just a few pages of story. That‚Äôs perhaps not Aaronovitch‚Äôs strong part. But what he does brilliantly is give even small characters a lot of heart and a lot of personality. So, if his wit, his humor and his love for building lovable chaps out of even the smaller parts, then this book is for you."
Sarah,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/118558-sarah,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54289642-tales-from-the-folly,"Three and a half stars. The first couple stories were very entertaining (though I'd read a few of them before), but the later ones were lacking in a certain joie de vivre (also true of the last couple books of the series). Still, nice to get a couple of different viewpoints, and a bit more building and filling out of the world."

Not a short story fan and a few at the beginning I had read but also many I had not.

Gladys Heaton,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54790476-gladys-heaton,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45886753-wish-upon-a-duke,Interesting but implausible. That‚Äôs not very specific but perhaps sufficient. I did not like the graphic sex that appeared at the very end. It came as a surprise. I can usually avoid books that are objectionable to me by the looking at the cover.

After the events happened in the main series I thought I‚Äôd lost him. I didn‚Äôt care if he was taking this journey to become a Shadowhunter, for me he wasn‚Äôt the same as he was, no matter what.
AND in this book he is feeling exactly the same, and that's why I mainly loved it.

Eh, it was really short and a good introduction I guess. The whole narration from Simon's POV was extremely funny. Not much happened in this story so I don't really have much to say. Mostly just Simon wandering aimlessly wallowing in his sadness that he doesnt have his memories.

This does not mean that racial injustice and inequity are not explored - they are. But these personal stories really shine for their character studies and personal challenges and not purely focused on racial inequities. I'm not saying that the stor"

I've never read a collection like Deesha Philyaw's ""The Secret Lives of Church Ladies"" before. It is a tight collection that explores the Black Southern Christian women's experience in their own words and their own light. By turns intimate, full of rage, sorrow, happiness and curiosity, Philyaw's characters are fully realized and engaging. Most of all, Philyaw's stories reveal the human side of"

This phenomenal book of short stories will no doubt create a fuss when it is released to the general public. In each story, Philyaw jumps right into the heart of it all and yanks the reader in alongside her so that we feel so much of what is being felt by the characters. She deliciously describes women in all their glory and mess; the heartbreaks and triumphs; and both the internal and external conflicts with all the contexts they entail. Parts of it were rel"

With that as a background, these stories carried with them the burden of institutional racism that women of color experience every day in America.

The men in the stories were tangential, there our of necessity, but that is exactly where they should have been.

Conner,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6461259-conner,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51582376-the-secret-lives-of-church-ladies,"A good collection focused on the needs and passions of various Black women and girls.

As the title suggests, the stories largely focus on each character's struggle to reconcile her religion with her sexual desires. Philyaw often treats these two themes as dichotomous, and I wish she would have pushed herself to explore with more nuance how faith and sexuality could coexist in one's life. Many of the stories felt like they were making the same point.

And yet, the women‚Äôs stories are all poetic in their own way, unique in their voices.

It‚Äôs certainly better written than other such collections (*cough*Let it Snow *cough*). My main problem is if you read the stories back-to-back, it‚Äôs very obvious how repetitive they are.

I wouldn't expect anything different from her. Everything she writes is so realistic, and ohh my feelings... When I realized Mags didn't want to be there during the countdown because she didn't want to see anyone else kissing Noel my heart felt heavy in my chest.

This book is a collection of 12 short stories by different authors, many that are quite popular at the moment. There is a bit of buzz about it and I'm not sure if I'll get to it this Christmas. The individual stories are:

1. Midnights by Rainbow Rowell - This was the first story I've read by Rainbow Rowell and it was really cute. It's the story of two best friends that meet on New Year's Eve"

Midnights by Rainbow Rowell- 5 stars- This was the first thing I've ever read by Rainbow, and it left me wanting more from her! I LOVED this story. It personally tugged on my heartstrings due to some nostalgia surrounding a high school crush, and the fact that this short of a story could tap into that is a testament to how lovely it was.

5/5

Well, it's Rainbow Rowell, people...
I wouldn't expect anything different from her. Everything she writes is so realistic, and ohh my feelings... When I realized Mags didn't want to be there during the countdown because she didn't want to see anyone else kissing Noel my heart felt heavy in my chest.

This book is a collection of 12 short stories by different authors, many that are quite popular at the moment. There is a bit of buzz about it and I'm not sure if I'll get to it this Christmas. The individual stories are:

1. Midnights by Rainbow Rowell - This was the first story I've read by Rainbow Rowell and it was really cute. It's the story of two best friends that meet on New Year's Eve"
Samantha,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10067920-samantha,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20309175-my-true-love-gave-to-me,"This was a lovely short story collection that introduced me to a number of authors that I haven't read before.

Midnights by Rainbow Rowell- 5 stars- This was the first thing I've ever read by Rainbow, and it left me wanting more from her! I LOVED this story. It personally tugged on my heartstrings due to some nostalgia surrounding a high school crush, and the fact that this short of a story could tap into that is a testament to how lovely it was.

The Lady and the Fox by Kelly Link- 3 stars- I en"

Midnights By Rainbow Rowell

5/5

""'You're a kaleidoscope. You change every time I look away.'""

I'm a sucker for best friends turned lovers. Rowell didn't disappoint with her personality-rich characters and simple yet masterful writing. I thoroughly enjoyed the time lapse and the cutesy plot. Totally something I reread.

Rainbow Rowell can do no wrong and this story was adorable with a little hint of melancholy and nostalgia. It's remarkable how well developed her characters are in this short story and how much I've come to care about them.
Midnights is about the countdown to New Year over the course of 4 years with a certain bunch of characters and Rainbow has captured that excitement, fear and reluctance of starting a new year perfectly. This is definitely one of my favorite s"

The cuteness, guys. Rainbow Rowell is the queen of this kind of story: simple and cute, but unique. She creates good characters in 24 pages, making you melt and truly feel for them.

2.5/5 stars for Midnights by Rainbow Rowell
This was sweet and I loved Ned's eccentricity but the ending was SO dramatic and there was nothing memorable or original about it.

4/5 stars for The Lady and the Fox by Kelly Link
This had an Alice in Wonderland or Narnia vibe to it. This begins in a typical contemporary romance format but quickly diverges from the expected to mysterious and mystical territory. One star lost for the rushed ending.

5/5

Well, it's Rainbow Rowell, people...
I wouldn't expect anything different from her. Everything she writes is so realistic, and ohh my feelings... When I realized Mags didn't want to be there during the countdown because she didn't want to see anyone else kissing Noel my heart felt heavy in my chest.

2.5/5 stars for Midnights by Rainbow Rowell
This was sweet and I loved Ned's eccentricity but the ending was SO dramatic and there was nothing memorable or original about it.

4/5 stars for The Lady and the Fox by Kelly Link

Second was a story by Nalini Singh, whom I've not read before. I liked it, it was easy to read, paced just right for a short story, with memorable worldbuilding and good characters. I might read more of her books in the future.

It contains really fast insta-lust and Charles makes some comment to Anna about how she will 'enjoy' sex with him after she flat-out tells him she isn't interested. But I know where the story goes. I know Charles eventually loses that chip on his shoulder."

The second and third stories were very good, although the third had been edited to the point where so much was left out it leaves you wishing you could know the rest of the story.

'Some Desperado' by Joe Abercrombie

Considering how well known Abercrombie is for his lengthy novels, he did surprisingly well with this briefer format, a prequel of sorts to Red Country that introduces the character Shy South.

It was a nice surprise to find a Sanderson novella in this anthology. Our MC is a dangerous woman who plays an inn-keeper through the day and a bounty hunter through the night.

It was a nice surprise to find a Sanderson novella in this anthology. Our MC is a dangerous woman who plays an inn-keeper through the day and a bounty hunter through the night. One of the things I very much like in Sanderson books is that there is always at least one very strong female character around and this story doesn't make an exception. The plot though was nothing special and there were some quite vividly crue"

How could this possibly go wrong?

I mean, they're just so awesome!

I'll review what I've read so far and update as I go.

The Highest Justice by Garth Nix.

Nix! You're one of my favourite authors! This story was kind of awesome in that I felt like this should have been the beginning to one of your amazing big adventure series. Instead, just as it got started and became exciting, it ended! It was too big an idea squeezed into too small a story that you just couldn't do it the jus"

And I grew up on The Last Unicorn, bad singing and all. So when I heard of the concept of this book, what makes better fiction, zombies or unicorns? I had to smile. What a fun idea for a short story anthology.

I cracked the cover thinking ""zombies for the win, all the way."" I never laugh when I read, crack a smile at most, but not laugh. The introduction alone, a debate between editors Holly Black and Justine Larbalestier about the benefit"

Thoughts:
1. Loved Holly and Justine's intro to each story. Justine is hilarious.
2. Surprisingly, a lot of mature content. FYI.
3. Loved how most of the stories were really dark.

Before reading this book of short stories I was completely Team Unicorn. I mean they're like an extreme evolution of horses and who doesn't love horses let alone unicorns?

I've finally read all of these stories!!!! The last seven stories were the best. As for the first five, they were not very good. I know a lot of people liked Bougainvillea and A Thousand Flowers, but I thought they were kind of boring.
Team Zombie won for me. I really only hated the unicorn stories that took place in medieval times.

Holly Black is thoroughly on the side of unicorns, which she says are noble and beautiful and far better than those icky, shambling zombies (she disapproves of shambling).

Justine Larbalestier thinks unicorns are rainbow farting freaks, while zombies clearly symbolize the human condition and can comment on any aspect of our existence.

I really enjoyed each story, though I certainly had my particular favorites. Would highly recommend snagging a copy of this one, particularly if you're a romcom/meet cute fan like me!"

I don't usually read anthologies, because when I like a short story I will want it to keep on going and then I feel disappointed when I'm not given more. This is a YA anthology featuring 14 stories about meet-cutes. Most of those weren't all that cute, but I'm still rounding up the rating because of the few stories I unconditionally loved.

""Siege Etiquette"" by Katie Cotugno: 4 stars
This little story was a surprise, told in second-person POV. The story centers around two characters who've known each other their whole lives but find a connection while hiding out from the police at an underage party (in the bathroom). The story was a lot less ""cute"" than bittersweet, but I loved how much story Cotugno managed to stuff into such a small package"

SEIGE ETIQUETTE by Katie Cotugno 2/5
I don't know why I didn't necessarily like this story as much as the others. Maybe it was because I recently reviewed Cotugno's latest book, Top Ten. It fell like I was going back and forth way too much. Besides one of my major negatives for ANY book has to be adultery/cheating of any kind.

SIEGE ETIQUETTE by KATIE COTUGNO
3.5 stars
Cute little story about a boy and a girl getting stuck in the bathroom together at a house party. Written in second person.

This story was fun, but slightly boring. The characters weren't as fleshed out as I would have liked and the pacing was very slow. Also I didn't like how the characters opinions flopped so quickly.

Spellbound / L.A. Banks

A modern twist on the classic Hatfield and McCoy feud. I think it was meant to be mostly funny, but it was too cutesy and had a 1950s morality vibe though I believe it was set present day.

I just can't take it anymore.
Not only does the writing range from mediocre to pretty bad, it committed the unforgivable sin of boring me to tears. One star.

When I'm reading a short story, I expect mood, I expect atmosphere. When I'm reading an anthology about goddamn witches, I expect some goddamn magic. Unfortunately, I could find nothing but more teenage angst (the severely irksome kind) that anyone asked for ever in the history of times and generic plots."

These shorts are not all romantically driven -- some are -- but they all center around the holiday traditions -- Santa, reindeer, baking cookies, gift giving, etc.

Out of all the stories, I only liked 4 (""liked being a broad term here) & deeply enjoyed one. I just felt a lot of them had flat, interchangeable characters that didn't bring the text to life. I know they're ""short stories"" but that doesn't mean they have to be lacking substance! The historical part was good, but boring mainly due to we"

I didn't truly hate any of the stories in this collection, though some were vastly better than others. I had not read things previously from over half of the authors before, but I am definitely interested in checking out more work from them in the future.

This anthology was a remarkable accomplishment, collecting stories set all over the world (though mostly US) featuring queer teen protagonists.

The cons: A few of the stories just didn't really do that much for me, but when it's an anthology of stories by different authors, it's highly unlikely that I'll love the work of every author. The ones that I did like were very moving and effective. I jus"

'A Year and a Day in Old Theradane' by Scott Lynch

An excellent short story about a team of former rogues, including a wizard and a steampunk robot, who have retired to the city of Old Theradane, a magical place with psychedelic colored rain and a pub inside the skeleton of a dragon, only to be brought out of retirement to steal an entire street. I hope that this isn't the only story Lynch writes featuring these characters, as I really enjoyed the brief"

Tough Times All Over by Joe Abercrombie - 4.5/5 stars
First time reading a story by this author and I really enjoyed it! We follow a package as it changes hands many, many times. The perspective shifts and follows the package. I enjoyed that we got to see each characters motivations in such a short story and it was a bit of fun.

""Tough Times All Over"" by Joe Abercrombie. Basically, this is a story of pass-the-parcel.

Jaime K,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13180341-jaime-k,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20168816-rogues,"This is an anthology about characters who are roguish - unlikeable in their own worlds but have quirks that make the reader almost root for them.
The language and sex is pretty subdued considering how harsh some of the authors typically write. There were same-sex couplings that took me by surprise.


Tough Times All Over by Joe Abercrombie

In Sipani, a stolen package makes its rounds through the hands of different rogues in the city, some who do even understand its importance. The issue is t"

There are only so many ways to say ""Well a lot of them sucked but some of them were pretty good"". So I'm going to do 21 micro-reviews.

‚ÄúTough Times All Over‚Äù by Joe Abercrombie - The first story introduces a LOT of rogues, as a mysterious package gets nicked over and over again by a series of different characters. Abercrombie recycles the chained-point-of-view-death structure that he used to great success in The Heroes. Excellent opener to"

Scott Lynch and Patrick Rothfuss stories. Yes please. Rogue characters up to presumably no good. Yup, I‚Äôd like a helping of that. A giant book of short stories that I could entirely knock an intruder out with. Colour me excited!
The problem; I‚Äôm stupidly stubborn enough to read it all the way through. I probably shouldn‚Äôt have.

This was my reading experience with this book. Some were really good, many were fine, a few were not to my taste and a few were really extraordanary. I ad hoped that the two I had a previous connection with would not be the two best in this anthology, but they were. It might be because my great love of Gaiman and Rothfuss and because I have read quite a bit of both these authors (I had read The Name"
Amanda Kespohl,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21280574-amanda-kespohl,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20168816-rogues,"This anthology occasionally had a very bro-y feel. There was one story where a pair of men were having women stand in line to show intimate parts of their body to them to decide if they should be recruited for a heist, and another where the chance to see a woman naked without her consent is traded as payment. And of course, in the latter tale, she responds to the violation of her privacy by sleeping with the rogue in question. Then there was the story where I was just starting to get into the pl"
Res,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56479-res,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20168816-rogues,"I was afraid that it would get monotonous to read an entire collection on a theme of roguery, but I was pleasantly surprised. On the other hand, more than half the stories got abandoned because they couldn't manage to engage me in the first couple of pages due to requiring long slogs through a lot of clumsily handled exposition, either of worldbuilding or of characterization.

A lot of these stories are set in the universes of books I haven't read (or, in the case of Neverwhere, haven't read for"
Terence,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1019174-terence,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20168816-rogues,"Rogues, as the title suggests, is a serviceable collection of 21 stories about scoundrels, not outright villains but likable antiheroes (always more interesting than the neighborhood paladin). The stories cover a variety of genres, though SF and fantasy predominate. None of these are unreadable but none, for me, stood out. The best (3+ stars) are Gillian Flynn's ""What Do You Do?"" and Walter Jon Williams' ""Diamonds from Tequila."" The first is about a grifter who meets her match in an even more so"

Considering the book was only edited/compiled by George R. R. Martin should have told me not to have the high expectations that I ended up having when I eventually picked up this book.

Ultimately, the beginning I thought was brilliant. Tough Times All Over, I thought was quite interesting, in my opinion, but at the same time, predictable. I had already guessed how the short was going to end even before the package got to the third person. I s"

As obvious from the cover, this is a collection of stories about ""rogues"". What's not so obvious based on the big name contributors, is that these are not all fantasy stories. It's fantasy heavy for sure, but there are also stories about everything from detectives to substitute teachers who are likeable but not exactly straight shooters. Sometimes barns are stormed"

It's a collection of short stories from a number of great authors!
It was perfect to pick this up between other books and read one or two stories and then put it down till the next time I need a break from other books or between books.
Not only where most of the stories actually a great read,

Once I'm in it it's already over. So I kept not wanting to start another story and just not enjoying reading this. I ended up dnf'ing about halfway through. It's not that it's not enjoyable it's just not for me."
