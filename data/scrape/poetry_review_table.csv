Every once in awhile I like to dip my toes into a novel channeled through poetry, and this one maintains a nice blend of traditional beauty and modern relevance. While I usually don't embrace stories where a majority of the conflict could have been solved by two characters just having a simple conversation, I do understand that mother/daughter relationships can be very strained and it can be difficult to overcome this bridge.

As a poet, I adore the poetry style of writing. Moreover, the author also incorporated email and texting formats.

Cordelia has never quite felt like she fit into her family. She jokes that she’s the .5 kid in the average family of 2.5 kids. But when she chooses to get her DNA results as part of her senior project on identity, she finds a bit more truth than she was looking for. When she finds out that the man who raised her isn't her biological father, it sends her on a quest to find out where she belongs.

It's kind of a fascinating experience to read a book for teens by Tony Abbott, once a prominent figure in my reading life at seven-years-old now twenty years later. Junk Boy is a novel in verse, featuring a damaged and quiet boy. Bobby Lang, or Junk as his classmates call him, lives in a destitute and traumatic situation. His father, a desolate drunk, is absent at best and cruel at worst. For Bobby, life drags along in a mi"

Laya,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/121399471-laya,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53142770-dkmh,It was unique to include a recommended playlist of songs to listen to while reading. It helped set the tone of the poetry however I did think some of them lack proper flow and while nice thoughts to read overall it did lack memorability. A spoken word format would have been better to add depth.

I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley. All thoughts and opinions are my own.

The poems are bland and there's nothing special or memorable in the book really. It's weird in a different way."

Now, about her books...Enjoyed “Adultolescence” a lot and “Dandelion” is another winner! Bravo Gabbie! Love your words, thoughts and drawings! Keep up the great work."

I I I could tell that Gabbie poured her heart into the illustrations, the poems, and especially the memoir at the end. While yes, some poems are just thoughts, they are thoughts that I have also had but never knew how to write or share, and Gabbie does.

Fortunately, I still loved it! Lots of metaphors really made me stop and think, and I believe that this may be better than her first book. 3 years was definitely worth the wait! Also, my Target edition extras were amazing too!

I’ve watched Gabbie Hanna’s videos on YouTube before, and I saw the high ratings for this (on Amazon, that is.) Reading this between other books because I figured it would be a simple read, I was able to finish it in an hour or so. It’s very simple and accessible. I suspect the targeted demographic was preteens, which is why I personally rate the poems 2-2.5 stars.

First, this isn't really a poetry book, and I don't think it was supposed to be. Some entries are poems, some are just random thoughts, there are illustrations galore, and I think it's meant to be taken as a whole, not in parts. That's not to say it's *good* but I don't think it's bad either. For what it is, I honestly enjoy it. It feels like a peek into Gabbie's mind rather than serious prose, and that's just the sort of thing I eat up."

I really enjoyed her first poetry collection, and I know a of people didn’t. I was eager to pick up this one. I will say, I think I liked her first collection a little bit better, but I might have to go back for a reread.

I did listen to this on audio because I think there’s a real value in hearing someone read their own work, especially something so autobiographical."

This was fun to read! Much like Gabbie's first book, there were some poems I liked and some I didn't. The art, though, was gorgeous and a joy to see sprinkled throughout the book. I bought the Barnes and Noble edition and really enjoyed the Letters to Strangers segment at the end."
Solinel,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43402018-solinel,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50891678-dandelion,4 stars. I liked it more than her first book. I do think it was better. You can see that she's grown as a writer. I listened to this so I don't get to comment on her art but I bet it was pretty and funny. I'd like to read it later on and annotate which were my favorites.

I placed a small heart sticker in the top corner of each of the pages that contained poems that either especially spoke to me or made me laugh.

Although she is my favorite artist, I always listen to her music and read her books with an open mind and I try to be as impartial as I can, and every time she never fails to amaze. I strongly, truly feel that when she was doing vine and back when she was TheGabbieShow, she was more loud and dramatic (like a normal young adult); but when that was who she was, that is also who I was.

However, I still don’t find these types of “poems” to even be poetry, and Gabbie Hanna certainly doesn’t manage to convince me that they are. That being said, the “poems” that were longer than 1-5 lines were much better than the shorter ones.
Most of these “poems” just fall victim to the same old thing that happens every time I read these sorts of books: they come off like twee"

Rather than stay safe with just simple, short, fun poems, Gabbie reveals her darkest vices through such intricate and harrowing forms of symbolism weaved into stories of trauma, fear, and despair. Yet, Gabbie utilizes her creativity to transform these into much more than just “stories”. Her artwork is just as wondrous, creating"

I wanted to see growth from her writing however it remained pretty much the same (very 2013 tumblr post-esc), with few minor exceptions (being a slight effort in the form). The rhythm is off, it's wrong and boring and that makes the poems hard to read.

It’s always a good, easy read, but it rarely makes me feel anything on any sort of a deep level. I feel that Gabbie is much better at expressing things through music, or through simply talking out loud. The poetry never speaks to me the way her music does, but maybe that’s because when I’m reading it, it’s my own voice inside my own head so it doesn’t give the same impact.

Some poems have multiple meanings, some really hit you in the feels and others are silly to balance out the reality of the tragedy that brought all these words out.

There are poems that can relate to almost all people; the silly, happy, sad, depressed, moody, excited, etc. Depending on the book version you got, there are tons of extras that add into the life of Gabbie Hanna! You can see the effort and hard work that she and her team put i to this, and I feel that poetry should become a norm in everyone’s lives, starting with Dandelion."

It is filled with simple, fun poems, illustrations, limericks and stories that give you a look into the way the author has experienced life and the world, many of which are relatable, make you laugh, or just make you feel some type of way.

This collection (I cant call them poems) was very angsty and depressing. Most of the book were short observations with a few poems sprinkled throughout. The last section was a collection of letters.

No. But I also didn’t expect it to be. I could tell it was real. It had a lot of heart behind it, and I related to most of it. I think it was a 4 star read before the last 20 or so pages.

I felt like she actually put a huge amount of effort and her best work yet. Loved the connection to this and it didn't feel force or like she needed to write poems just to write them.

I do think the price is high and I have an Overdrive account so I checked out the audiobook for free. I had moments where I cringed, and yet I was enthralled with some of her stories (being a trauma survivor myself). 3 stars is the most neutral review I give."

The ""poetry"" however is the same - it reads like twitter drafts. Gabbie - write more about your experiences like at the end of this book and you could put out a decent book."

Reading this book and going through the stages of love and loss made me feel like it’s okay to be human.

'Asking for help isn't giving up,' said the horse. 'It's refusing to give up.”

I contemplated not counting this since it's essentially a picture book, but this honestly made me tear up! I'm a bit conflicted on the star rating, however, simply because anything I try to give it feels off for me. That being said, everything about this was incredibly beautiful. The ideas presented are not exactly unique, but paired"

A really good friend gave me a copy of this. He’d been inspired after his wife had given him a copy when he’d found himself walking a rocky path. It is inspiring.

I could throw a couple of quotes in here but that might just give away too much. Better for me to say that you should read it. It will Change your life.

I first heard about this book after seeing one of Charlie Mackesy's sketches with a beautiful handwritten inspirational message. I think I was initially drawn to it because it featured a fox 🦊, and everyone knows I love 🦊.

I was so taken with it that I googled him to find out more.
That's where I found more of his 'sketches with meaning' ... I was immediately hooked!
I went out the following day and bought this, his latest book, and sat there in the city bookstore reading it."

The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse is one of the most beautiful books I’ve ever read. Similar to Winnie the Pooh in its style and tone, it’s uplifting, its filled to the brim with hope and it will resonate with everyone.
“What do you want to be when you grow up?

A simple journey of four beings, co-existing and helping each other get through life, told so beautifully that you can't help but fall in love with it! The illustrations are mind-blowing and every page"

Heart-warming and life-affirming. The simplicity of the pen-and-ink drawings pair beautifully with the words (which often reminded me of my Zen Buddhism class). Universal truths and wisdom presented through heartfelt conversations between this unlikely group of friends. To be enjoyed by young and old.

A few of my favourite lines:
“Is your glass half empty or half full?” asked the mole.
“I think I’m grateful to have a glass,” said the boy.

favorite pieces were sportcruiser, the land of 1000 fires, paradise is very fragile and the title poem."

Picking this up was mainly triggered by sheer curiosity and putting this down was dominated by feelings of utter surprise: this is good.



For those unfamiliar with what Lana Del Rey is doing out there, she's mainly known for her music and with her songs all reminiscent of a 50s America-nostalgia (sometimes more sometimes less successfully) combine"

The collection starts off excellently with the first poem “LA Who Am I To Love you”, which tells of Del Rey yearning for LA after moving to San Francisco and feeling out of place there. The rest of the collection was a bit of a mixed bag for me.

She does not try to sound like any other poet but herself. She does not try to sound smarter or deeper than she actually is by using unnecessarily obscure words.

Am I biased? Yes.

Did I still think this was genuinely wonderful? Also, yes.

Lana Del Rey has the loveliest speaking voice. It's like old money and rich velvet and red wine - or maybe rosé in this case - so you can imagine what it was like having her softly speak poetry in my ear for close t0 forty minutes.

I really enjoyed the main poems of the book. My criticism is only that the book is soooo short, filling it in with “poet’s pages” and large photography, not using page numbers, lots of blank space... it’s a really tiny book and yet expensive. It’s beautiful and I like to think I’ll pick it up again sometime, but it should’ve been a bit longer to really constitute a book. Beautif"

She can capture a time, a place, an emotion like not many others can, often making me incredibly nostalgic over something that never even happened to me. Some of her lyrics sure are questionable, but she definitely knows how to paint a picture through words. This is what I hoped to find in her poetry as well.

Sometimes Kaur weaves together profound thoughts, and other times she simply write statements that have line spacing every other word. Half of the poems are about heartbreak and relationships, whic"

Kaur’s second poetry collection suffered from a lack of coherence within its sections, and from digression from its own stories. The basic story is a tale from heartbreak to depression to love to hope for the future. Within that framework, Kaur digs into other, deeply personal struggles, from her sexual assault to the struggles she has with her b"

Rupi Kaur is so relatable, this book took me on an emotional roller coaster ride.

The Sun and Her Flowers is similar in various regards: again we're presented with stories about love and loss in all its various forms and stages. This time around, the book is divided"

I enjoyed this even more then Rupi Kaur's first book milk and honey. In this collection Rupi's poetry has matured and is expressed in different ways. The five parts of this book describe the many emotions women and men experience through their romantic, platonic and family relationships.

THERE were some poems in here that were absolute standouts and I think that's why I liked it slightly more than Milk and Honey. This felt like a deeper exploration of Kaur's past, of her growth as a person, and I genuinely enjoyed reading some of the longer poems.

I don't think I can express how important, poignant and devastating this novel was to read.

I could sit here for hours contemplating how to begin this review, but I don’t think there’s any way to be concise or coherent about it. I am not Black, I do not carry as hefty a weight on my shoulders that begs me to be careful in the most innocent of situations.

What expectations arise and what stereotypes we need to fight against. The images her poems invoke are wonderful and she convey such emotion, but with so much tranquility.

This book of poetry describes the soul of a woman, the want, the need and the desire for more that you can have.

Rebecca Enslein,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63326583-rebecca-enslein,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50997643-what-kind-of-woman,"I’ve never read a book of poetry before, much less purchased one. I’m so glad my first time for both was with this one! I found Kate on Instagram and had admired her work long before the book came out. She manages to describe the life of an adult woman in a way that is simultaneously unflinchingly honest about the ugly parts and beautiful. I loved it!"
Suzy,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65721772-suzy,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50997643-what-kind-of-woman,"Thanks to Harper Perennial for the free early copy. This one unfortunately just didn’t work for me. I wasn’t familiar with Baer or her Instagram before going into this, and I don’t think I’m the right demographic (not a wife or a mother, don’t typically vibe with this specific branding of empowerment). I’m sure fans of her work will love this."
Cate,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7406404-cate,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50997643-what-kind-of-woman,"I feel seen. She put words to things I didn’t think could ever be expressed. “To unclasp the thought of leaving, tie it to the door. To run I to the gaping mouth of change and know it’s suffering. To find the ones who say, I am not afraid of sitting in the dark with you.”

Witchcraft.

Thank you, Kate."

I read it all in one sitting and have gone back again today to re-read. The way she writes about marriage and being a woman- it’s not idealized or glamorized, it’s honest but not harsh. She makes the beauty of the ordinary apparent."
Kate,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35467021-kate,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50997643-what-kind-of-woman,"“For now just remember how you felt the day you were born: desperate for magic, ready to love.”

I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this poetry collection. I usually have a shaky relationship with poetry, but Baer does a phenomenal job at gut punches and all the feels."
Kathy,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14405495-kathy,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50997643-what-kind-of-woman,This book just touched my soul with its beautiful and burrowing honesty.

Things have changed lately, though - ZJ’s dad is moody and has excruciating headaches from all the blows to the head he’s taken through the years. ZJ has to learn to deal with a new reality as his family deals with his dad’s health crisis.

I just love Woodson’s writing and the way she brings a story"

I can hear her voice soft and slow, and see her son’s eyes eager for reassurance. It isn’t just this scene. It is every single one that Woodson paints with a brush so powerful that I’m pulled into the canvas and surrounded by the characters. So it comes as no surprise when my heart races and I find myself pleading, trying desperat"

When ZJ’s pro-football player father begins losing bits and pieces of his memory and suffers from chronic headaches the family must come to terms with the man ZJ’s father is becoming and finding the new normal. For instance ZJ and his dad share a love of music. Sometimes it’s just listening to old music, sometimes it’s music they write together. ZJ also has his boys, his awesome friends who are there for"

I love Jacqueline Woodson. I am always enamored with her talent. I mean, Brown Girl Dreaming, Harbor Me and Another Brooklyn are phenomenal. And she always makes me cry! Her newest middle grade novel Ever After is softly sad, yet hope remains. From that quote above we're warned by ZJ that his story does"

First things first, let’s take a moment to appreciate the illustration of the book cover. It’s so darn pretty!

My husband and I are football fans and have seen real players exhibit the same signs of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) that Zachariah Jr's father does in this novel.

In Woodson's trademark spare but precise telling, readers are invited into a world that examines the price some people pay for success and glory on the gridiron. Told from the perspective of ZJ, Jr. readers learn of the decline of his football star father resulting from years of blows to the head. A lovely rendering of the bond between father unfolds as ZJ reminisces about the g"

The boy narrator of this work is tender and raw, vulnerable and authentic. Woodson has so masterfully entered the voice and mind of a 12-year-old boy while maintaining the maturity of her poetic art. The topic is one I’ve barely considered at all, but which clearly deserves far more consideration in our culture. It must be time to face how our mass desire for the brutality of the football field deep"

Jacqueline Woodson has done it again. She crafted this incredibly poignant story chronicling a family’s struggles when the professional football player father suffers from traumatic brain injuries. This book offers so many rich opportunities for discussion and writing. I’d loved to be in the room when a group of tween football fans talk about this book. Woodson can do no wrong.
Heidi Burkhart,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16095582-heidi-burkhart,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51988656-before-the-ever-after,"Woodson is a superb writer. She continues to write one top notch book after another. This story is likely to appeal to all students, but I think boys who are reluctant readers might especially enjoy the story about ZJ, whose dad is a pro football player. His dad's career results in devastating brain damage, and this story demonstrates how the family works through this catastrophe.

Excellent, and highly recommended."

I want to be friends with them. For instance, the dad is a big, tough football player, but he teaches ZJ it’s okay to cry, and his favorite singer is Rufus Wainwright. ZJ’s friends, ZJ himself - I want kids to read this book and feel like they’re their friends, too.

12 year old ZJ narrates, describing how his dad changes and how their life changes as his dad is affected by the brain trauma caused by tackles in American football."

First, it was not done in what many of us consider the typical memoir format. We don't get all of our (sometimes unsavory) appetites fed. We don't find out all of the backstory on every person, we don't even find out details we might think pertinent to wrapping up the story, which so many readers in the United States seem to think is prerequisite.

This journey into her past was painful for Trethewey, but she felt compelled to write this tribute to her mother."

Her parents separate and she and her mother move to Atlanta where she meets a disturbed man that she marries."

Trethewey is a former US Poet Laureate with a long list of honors and awards. As she shared in an interview for Politics and Pros, along with the honors came more inquiry into her past. Trethewey’s mother Gwendolyn Ann Turnbough was murder by her second ex-husband when Trethewey was a young adult. Instead of having this trauma included as a footnote, Trethewey wants to give her mother the attention and vitality she deserves. Without the loving adoration and involvement of her mo"

Memory.

Much of Trethewey's book focuses on her early childhood and teenage years, much of which was suppressed after the traumatic murder of her mother. The book is a process of returning to the site of trauma in hopes of a resolution, or a sense of closure.

Of course, we're made up of what we've forgotten, too, of what we've tried to bury or suppress. Some fo"

Connor and Ana had been having an affair for three years and although they last spoke only a few days prior, it was in anger. Now what would Ana do? She couldn’t come to terms with what"

In one way or another, I think almost everyone can identify with the above. The realization that a relationship you hold so dear; has ended.

Adultery! And the consequences of sudden, unexpected death and the emotional consequences. It’s a fascinating contradiction.
Francois Mitterand led a double (private) life for thirty two years and his “other woman” said after his death revealed the complexity of the situation: “François had a marvellous phrase. ‘The only eternal love is one that hindered,’ ”

Loneliness and regret permeate.

It does boggle my mind how much has changed since June when he submitted the final draft to his publishers. It also boggles my mind to realize how many people have left 45's administration in just 4 years."

You'll be surprised how many ""characters"" have come and gone through the White House and thankful the author has put it all in delirious context for you. Lithgow remains one of our finest American talents - is there anything the man can't do?"

This may be the best book of poetry I’ve ever read! Lithgow gets it right in every poem. Fun to read, and in many cases it brings back memories, since things have changed at such a rapid pace in the last four years, he reminds of the chaos we have lived through. I read this in one sitting of about an hour!"
Gail,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46302406-gail,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53710467-trumpty-dumpty-wanted-a-crown,"The multi-talented John Lithgow has done it again with a witty, comic, yet sadly true collection o poetry and limericks, each with a cogent explanation of the story behind each poem. The frosting on the cake are the illustrations, also penned by Lithgow, making this an apt read for this week in history."

The poems, however, got a bit boring. If the book was a bit shorter I would have been more content. That being said, I did also appreciate the brief explanation/reminder about each situation or political slimeball following each poem. That helped bring things together for me."

This is savy, cute, cutting and dangerously true. Who knew you, John Lithgo, could do great line drawings and make sure that history is not rewritten. I am so much of a fan. Will give this book to many of my friends."

There is something absurd afoot when the US people can seriously consider a President for a second turn who lies routinely and fires those who disagree. John Lithgow catches and condenses that to perfection."

This text blends Sissay’s own recollections of his upbringing in foster care and group homes with artifacts from his file at length obtained from Social Services, laying bare the contrast between the life he experienced and the one that appears in the documentation. Told all his life that his mother didn’t want him, he learns that she was kept from reuniting with him, even as"

Lemn does not just write. Lemn speaks with an intensity that is rarely matched in any medium. His story is one of a child hidden within the bureaucracy of the 'Care' System. It is a short work.

This is the story of his childhood in the UK care system. This book broke my heart on multiple occasions.
He was ‘stolen’ from his Ethiopian mother and spent his life being let down repeatedly by the social care system. This is a story of racism, neglect and failings by the authorities. But, it’s also a story of hope and resilience.
A must read book."

A very good book. I thought the use of social services documentation was stunning and made plain the absence of care from almost every adult in his life. It really rammed home the painful conseque"

i think this is the first time i'm reading nonfiction for fun, although this wasn't fun. this was visceral and profound and made me catch my breath a few times. right in the opening of this book, its prologue, so to speak, jenny slate describes her wish to be perceived as parisian woman; she wants to be consumed as a croissant. it was this, more than anything else, that my mind kept returning to. somehow, in her own idiosyncratic way, jenny found the words to voice a feeling i've been having"

It is you.
You are happy for yourself that you have received the honor of a new day on which to ride. You realize that you love yourself easily in this gravity-free space between the worlds of waking and dreaming.
You are dear to yourself"

Nonetheless, I do think my unpopular opinion of this book would have remained unchanged.

4+ of 5 stars to Where the Sidewalk Ends, a collection of poetry published in 1974 by Shel Silverstein. What a wonderful book to read with children at any age; that is, both any age for the reader and the children! I first read this book when I was about 10-years-old, and then again in college.

This morning I jumped on my horse
And went out for a ride.
And some wild outlaws chased me
And they shot me in the side.
So I crawled into a wildcat’s cave
To find a place to hide,
But some pirates found me sleeping there,
And soon they had me tied
To a pole and built a fire
Under me-I almost cried
Till a mermaid came and cut me loose
And begged to be my bride.
So I said I’d come back Wednesday
But I must admit I lied.
Then I ran into a jungle swamp
But I forgot my guide

I used to sing along with the Irish Rovers as they sang The Unicorn. Little did I know that the lyrics are based on a poem in THIS book entitled The Unicorn. Got me to singing again.

It is so nice to stop and read a book or books that can bring a smile to your face. If you haven't tried this book, I recommend it for the break from seriousness that it can provide.

This is both sad and joyous. Sad because I didn't read him sooner, but joyous because I get to discover him fully now as an adult. Nothing short of brilliant.

Amusing to a parent and giggly for the kid, many of the lessons implied by the poems aren't what I want to teach, but none of them were so bad for him that they weren't good as a jumping off point for a conversation.

This is my first book of Shel Silverstein and that's probably because he writes children's books. But this book/poem/graphic was pretty good. Although I liked this book, I think some poems in it shouldn't be read to young children.

I recommended for a gift to your children or granddaughter."

To cool in the peppermint wind

We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,

Rupi Kaur does it once again. Her poetry is blooming. Her words hit home as they always do. I mean, there's a reason why there's a surge in poetry books being sold now. She's the reason.

I love what she advocates in her poetry collections, what she stands for. How it is told in a format of stages, of growth. Following on from her previous collection (not that it is a sequel, but the format and themes are similar), the sun and her flowers is tackling the"

Kaur’s second poetry collection suffered from a lack of coherence within its sections, and from digression from its own stories.

THERE were some poems in here that were absolute standouts and I think that's why I liked it slightly more than Milk and Honey. This felt like a deeper exploration of Kaur's past, of her growth as a person, and I genuinely enjoyed reading some of the longer poems.

How a few short rightly placed words can evoke emotions of sadness, love, anger, or happiness.

But I decided to give this book of poetry and try"

Judging by the title alone I assumed this would be an uplifting collection of poems about women.
It was more a collection of (mostly) sad memories that I hope by sharing the author was able to work through some of them in a positive light.
It was too melancholic for me.

Poetry hasn't been my go-to since the late 90s, so it is even more surprising that I feel the way I do. I am not quite sure how only a few words spaced on a handful of pages can make me feel fear, pity, love, happiness. I am really looking forward to reading the rest of her poetry."

I read them out of chronological order (which I still think one can do without feeling lost) and this turned out to be my favourite. Maybe I became accustomed to modern poetry and the author's writing with the previous two books, so that I could fully appreciate her narrative in this one.

1. Write one long sentence.

I find them kind of boring. This book though was really good. I love Shel Silverstein's books and I plan on reading some of the others. This book is would be good for 3rd-6th graders. I like this book a lot better than any other poetry books I've read before. This book has a lot of interesting poems in it like Adventures of a Frisbee and It's all the same to the Clam.

He is both the author and illustrator of the whimsical poems and pictures, and I can see children laughing at the humor portrayed. The book seems appropriate for 2nd-5th grade.

I love Emily Dickinson's poetry. I recently went to a museum exhibit dedicated to her and fell in love again with one of her poems, which I'll dissect below:

Critics of Emily Dickinson’s poem number 328, commonly titled “A Bird Came Down the Walk,” have several different interpretations of the poem. Most critics believe that the poem is a “conventional symbolic account of Christian encounter within the world of nature…” (Budick 218). Although several critics take a religi"

After reading, I was left in wonder about this strange and reclusive woman who saw only a handful of her poems published before her death.

Sure, one can't deny how unreliable and prejudiced he is as a narrator - just look at how he twists the reality when describing the Cyclops' life and culture - but that's precisely - in addition to the engaging structure - what makes The Odyssey so readable and less 'old-felt' than The Iliad.

Re-read

I had to re-read this for class - and it's safe to say that I disliked this as much as I did 3 years ago. For an epic poem, it stays true to its roots of heroism and whatnot, but it's not something that interests me. However, I do appreciate the history that comes with it, considering the fact that it was the first epic-poem written. Yet, those things can't convince me to give this more than 2 stars. It's a pain to read.

Sorry, Beowulf. I hope to never read you again."

Well that was a surprise. I didn't expect at all to like this book (well, epic) at all, especially because I read it for university, but I ended up enjoying it quite a bit. I liked the characters, the plot, the setting and I especially liked the fantasy element to the story.

Not religious, so find it hard sometimes to read a lot of religious things like this due to the nature of it.

The whole walk/read was less than an hour, but an intense hour. Between the sunset and the poems, murmured aloud – often twice or more – I was full when I got home. Full of the richness of words, and perhaps also a bit overwhelmed by them. A strong poet will always create that feeling.

There are two voices here--one laments her absence, whereas the other celebrates her presence. The celebration of the lover is omnipresent in the texts--constant reference to the beloved.

The lament of the distant lover is more rare, but constant--from the beginning, the speaker says that ""to survive myself I forge you like a weapon"" (I.7), even so constructing her with ""eyes of absence"" (I.11). His words ""peopled the solitude that yo"

What I like about these poems the most, alongside its self-referentiallity, is its imperfectness. Had Neruda the time, patience, interest, he could have pruned these poems for them to be perfect, all the imagery that connects each poem in a constellation of symbols and allusions perfectly related, each verse having obvious correlation with the previous verse or with the set of poems as a whole, but in them not being so, Neruda renders them the more human, the more young and the more p"

To call it the best collection of poetry I've ever laid my eyes upon would be unjust because such a categorization would be inadequate, reductive and grossly diminishing. He talks about the darkest recesses of eroticism as a theologian would discuss the Trinatarian mystery: with absolute abandonment and cold-blooded lucidity.
Love conquers all, in the end."

That being said, I wasn't quite captivated by these poems. I think one would have to be in love romantically to really connect with them, whereas I was just treating the theme as an abstract object when reading this book, which is never quite as interesting. Maybe I'll change my rating in the future."

This book is a compilation of his poems. Well, as you see, he deals mostly on the topic of love.

1) It is so obvious why these Ancient Greek stories have survived for so many years-- it's all gory violence and sex. Homer tapped into these marketing tools early.

2) I now understand why puritanical attitudes toward female sexuality developed. Pretty much everything bad that happens is caused by Helen of Troy - ""slut that I am"" - running off with Paris, and Hera seducing Zeus. The ancients must have read this and been like """

1. Victory or defeat in ancient Greek wars is primarily the result of marital spats and/or petty sibling rivalry in Zeus and Hera’s dysfunctional divine household.

2. Zeus “the father of gods and men” is a henpecked husband who is also partial to domestic abuse.

The Iliad is an ancient Greek epic poem in dactylic hexameter, traditionally attributed to Homer. Set during the Trojan War, the ten-year siege of the city of Troy (Ilium) by a coalition of Greek states, it tells of the battles and events during the weeks of a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles.

“We men are wretched things.”.

• My first book this year! I’ve spent years planning to read it, since my dear English Prof. Thaer Al-Kadi told us about it and read some pages from it in our first literature class. It was in 2009. Now, nine years later, I finally managed to read it!
Better late than never!



• I’ve read Samuel Butler’s translation. I think it’s the easiest. BUT, TO BE HONEST, I loved Robert Fagles’ translation more – and I recommend it."
