""Stories come in so many forms: in charcoal, and in song, in paintings, poems, films. And books.""

This is a book about a girl, a boy, a devil, and the stories that get told and repeated and remembered. This is a tale of power dynamics and imbalances and what humans are willing to do to not feel trapped and alone. This is all about a young girl who lives her life for herself, who lives her life in spite of the odds, w"

It's interesting. I read a couple of reviews for this book that said it was a slow-starter and took a hundred or so pages to get going, so I thought it was a good sign when I fell in love with it right away. The premise captivated me, drew me in, and took me away to another time and place; to an 18th century French village where young Adeline is being forced into a marriage she doesn't want.

Adeline had wanted to be a tree.
To grow wild and deep, belong to no one but the ground beneath her feet, and the sky above, just like Estele. It would be an unconventional life, and perhaps a little lonely, but at least it would be hers. She would belong to no one but herself.

Adeline was always a dreamer, wishing for more than what was expected of young women in 18th-century France. When her parents plan to marry her off to a local widower, the thought of her life essentially ending is appalling to her, so she flees.

In that moment of panic, she meets a handsome, mysterious stranger, whose face she had envisioned many times in dreams. He offers her what she wants. ‚ÄúI want a chanc"

tl;dr: 'The Devil and the Dark Water' is a fantastic and entertaining Holmesian mystery with unexpected twists and turns.

This story takes place in 1634, on a Dutch East India company ship sailing from Indonesia to Amsterdam. The governor of the colony is onboard along with his wife and daughter, his mistress and her sons as well as some mysterious cargo which occupies most of the shipment. The usual complement"

This was great, though it was no The 7¬Ω Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle! In fact, for anyone who loved TSDoEH and is looking for the same sort of things in this book now (as I kind of did, to be honest), let me set your mind at rest by assuring you that the only things that are similar between these two novels are:

- the author
- the fact that there's a mystery(ies) to be solved

This was such an interesting take on a murder-mystery. I loved the atmosphere of the book, it reminded me a lot of Pirates of the Caribbean. I also really enjoyed the writing style, and the fact that each chapter ended with a cliff-hanger, making me want to constantly keep reading the book.

Impressive story, but it didn't fit me. I was mostly bored.
I'm actually not very fond of ships or open water or anything that has to do with being on the sea, but the fact that this story took place on a ship did nothing for me.

He can pull you in and make you feel like you're a part of the story. I thoroughly enjoyed the 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle and was intriqued by this book's premise, but was ultimately let down. The back story of one of the main characters takes up a lot of the plot and drags the forward momentum of the book; and get ready to spend more time on a boat then you thought was possible.

Kingdom of the Wicked is very reminiscent of The Darkfever series, which happens to be one of my favourite urban fantasy series, so, naturally, I very much enjoyed reading it.

That is until, Vittoria is found murdered, leaving Emilia and her family devastated. Emilia who is filled with grief vows to find her sister's killer, no matter what the cost. This r"

The memoir written in 1902, Mary MacLane‚Äôs I Await the Devil Is Coming (which I happen to own), is tied very closely to this story. This brick of a book revolves around the unorthodox deaths of students at Rhode Island‚Äôs The Brookhants School for Girls in 1902.

This novel follows three storylines that are all connected to one place: the Brookhants School for Girls. Located off the coast of Rhode Island, it‚Äôs hauntingly beautiful and mysterious. In 1902, three of the students die after forming the ‚ÄúPlain Bad Heroines‚Äù society after they form friendships based around a book given to them by their headmistress.

Rikki King,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10959427-rikki-king,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50496875-plain-bad-heroines,"A creepy story so sweet that it leans into rot, as fallen apples bursting in the late summer heat. Like a songwriter, Danforth carefully chooses four or five notes to create terror, starts by playing only one or two at a time, and rearranges them into different melodies before reaching a caterwauling crescendo.

Memorable, complicated characters and a truly terrifying setting make this one that will stick with you."

This is a beautifully written book set in a fictional fantasy world with cultures based on pre-Columbian American cultures (which is an awesome concept). It also has LGBTQ+ representation which is really nice to see, including a non-binary character.

It reminded me a bit of 'Uprooted' by Naomi Novik. It has some creepy elements here and there, but it felt like a childrensbook to me instead of young adu"

Third, I didn't relate with the main character, Kara, or the minor characters!

The story takes place in Macon, Georgia, during the 1920s Prohibition. G.W. Griffith releases a film called Birth of a Nation, and when Ku Klux Klan members view it, they become evil demons called Ku Kluxes.

What I loved the most about this book was the storyline. A story about women that have their powers stolen the moment they marry? That all this time they‚Äôve been dominated and seen as a breeding tool? I see it as such an incredible plot idea, so much angst, so much at stake, AND a great cause to fight for. You immediately know that this NEEDS a happy ending but what you‚Äôre looking for is the ride. The development. The story.

This book was a pleasant surprise. And it needs more attention too. Set in an alternative historical period which slightly represents the Victorian era, there exists magic that can be harnessed and used. But for women, this is not an advantage. They wear a type of collar which leashes their power and when they get married they have to lose their powers.

Which is almost derogatory,"

The Lives of Saints is a collection of vignettes about the saints from the Grishaverse. It is cute, and I think the longest story is 6 pages, with most being around 2.

I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it if you want to read some dark stories.

There‚Äôs something about Sankt Ilya in Chains‚Äô story that contradicts what we already knew about him in Shadow & Bone (let‚Äôs remember he is Baghra‚Äôs father), so I‚Äôm curious about it. Which one is the real story?

Ignoring that, I think it‚Äôs a very entertaining book."

Brandon Sanderson is usually inclusive in his characters. One thing he‚Äôs always done well is making the cast of his stories DIVERSE, and ‚Äî in my opinion ‚Äî not stereotype races.

Benjamin,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7984431-benjamin,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54511226-dawnshard,"Besides being one of the shortest books ever (thanks, Brandon Sanderson, for thinking a novel-length book is ‚Äúshort‚Äù), Dawnshard was a lot of fun.

Getting the perspectives of The Lopen and Rysn was entertaining to say the least, and there were some powerful messages in the story as well. Exciting action and some juicy cosmere tidbits to boot. Let‚Äôs just say that, as I anticipate the release of Rhythm of War, Dawnshard was far too short."
John Mendiola,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4007376-john-mendiola,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54511226-dawnshard,"This is certainly a far shorter novel (technically a novella) than Brandon's normal fare and it certainly was a much smaller affair though still packed with a lot of juicy details. Frankly, I'm surprised there was as much relevant information for the Cosmere here. I loved reading Rysh, Lopen and Cord. I wish there was an infinite pages to follow side chracters go on their own journey and path. Now I can't wait for the 4th stormlight book. Here we go!"

Well that certainly was A LOT of informations.

I just read it in one sitting (always nice to be able to do that with a Sanderson story). I really enjoyed the two POV of Rysn and Lopen. It was a lot of fun (especially with Lopen's chapters) and now I'll go read stuff on reddit and on the coppermind wiki because I'm sure I've missed a lot of informations..!

Several characters we have met before, and it was nice to get to know them better. The pacing was good (which is often a problem I have with his work), and the plot was good. Not a super exciting installment, but I did enjoy it."
Angela,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3430355-angela,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54511226-dawnshard,"Okay, so, *that* happened.

Wow.

I was expecting a fill-in-the-gaps-btween-novels piece, similar to Edgedancer.

I was not expecting....well....that.

Which is to say, Dawnshard is one of the most important installments in the Cosmere.

And I am very excited to see that one of my favorite characters, who thusfar has had a very minor role in the Stormlight series, may soon become one of the most important figures in Sanderson's mythos."

She's so great. I enjoyed the story as well and as per usual Brandon Sanderson fashion, I have a ton more questions!!!

My only complaint is Lopen. I really can't stand his character mostly. I don't understand why anyone thinks he's funny or a fun character, he's just so annoying. However, it seems at the end there may be some changes in his character so we'll hopefully see if he gets tolerable."

Turns out when restricted to a shorter format and to exploring the corners, edges and side-characters of Roshar, I find myself entertained and compelled just as much, if not more than in the (much, much) longer novels. It helps that Rysn has always been a highlight of the main novels' interludes, and now finds herself undeniably among the best characters of the series."
Sundeep,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49545669-sundeep,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54511226-dawnshard,"Overall, I loved this book. Mostly on the lighter side, which is what I'm looking for these days. Lopen and Rysn were great as main POV characters, as were some of the side characters. The tidbits for overall Cosmere was unexpected.

If I had to nitpick, there were plenty of things happening that it would've needed a much longer book to give them justice, especially the decisions made in the climax."
Sarwar,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39309869-sarwar,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54511226-dawnshard,"It is a novella. Never expect too much from a Novella, but it was still a good one.

I really missed this world, and even if The Lopen was the only character that featured in the main parts of the previous books, he was still awesome as always.

And Sanderson putting so much character development into Rysn in some 100 pages shows how great of a storyteller he is.

Also the ending leaves us with more questions than answers as always. Can‚Äôt wait for RoW release next week. HYPE!"

I‚Äôm a sucker for stories that explore new places, creating something new, and making even small, side characters awesome. Rysn shines all over in the book. The amount of work Brandon has done for Rhysn is to be appreciated.

This book has significant Cosmere mysteries. I really liked how he gives just enough information to make fans hungry for more.

Carissa Norris,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5916675-carissa-norris,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54511226-dawnshard,"Definitely enjoyed this addition! I was so glad to see some characters appear and glad to delve into a side character more. I love the perspective of the main character, a unique one you don't see often in literature. This novella also makes the mysteries of Roshar and the Cosmere all the more intriguing.

I did feel that some of the plot was too convenient and a solution to a previous problem too easily solved, pushing believability, thus the four stars."

Some of my favorite side-characters teaming up to go to my favorite side-location to reveal some majorly central new lore. This is basically the perfect book for me. Hard to explain exactly what I mean without going into specifics but this short novel not only majorly advances characters I DO like, it was a huge step forward for one character I have so far really been disliking.

Without spoiling anything this is absolutely required reading for Stormlight and Cosmere fans."

Every sentence is filled with purpose, and every event is rich with lore. With that said, we have soundly left the Sanderson era where you can pick up and read more or less anywhere. I've heard this book advertised as a possible standalone and it most certainly is not. I would say this novella requires not just knowledge of the previous Stormlight books, but as many others as you can get read."

It's a lovely novella that adds interesting pieces to the Cosmere-puzzle (at least for me who haven't read so many Cosmere books yet), and lets you get closer to characters you haven't gotten the chance to spend so much time with."

A Deal with the Elf King is a standalone fantasy romance and a reminiscent of the tales of Beauty & the Beast and Hades and Persephone.

It's enchanting in the way that truly feels like a fairytale.

To add the cherry on top, it builds around a few favorite tropes: Arranged Marriage, Enemies-to-Lovers, Slow-burn Romance.

How do you tell someone that this is a story that checks all the boxes and wraps you up in a world of things you could never have expected? Because it does.

I was expecting a fun light read to get me through this politically charged season, but I got something much larger and more grand than that. I love when a plot unfolds slowly and you're not given the entire picture from the get go. I love that the characters have time to develop slowly and we grow with them and their situation. T"

I have been waiting for the release of this book and I practically inhaled it in one sitting the moment it was released!

This book is so corny and dull I can't believe Kova has written this. It lacks imagination. It's everything I've already read ten times but even more boring. The heroine tries to be idealist and somewhat of a martyr, but it falls flat. The hero doesn't stand out either.

The ending is just so perfect you don't believe that it has actually ended this way. As Cuddles swims out in the ocean I was waiting for the other shoe to drop. The party of five has conquered the world! I highly recommend this book"

When the information overload ends, and we all are confronted with silence. When our light-emitting bricks go black, what happens? When the instant dopamine smack that technology gives us is taken away, what then?

The Silence is sparse and does not pack the punch that Underworld, Libra, or White Noise does. But Don DeLillo is still at the reigns. He has few peers,"

Interesting engagement with spectacle and mediatization, exploring a scenario that we've likely all thought of at one time or another: a total technological blackout. However, The Silence is impeded by its brevity. It feels sparser than any other DeLillo work - even more so than Point Omega - and just doesn't devote enough time to developing its core themes in a way that feels satisfying and memorable, which is ironic given the loss-of-memory incurred by the death of the digital world.

DeLillo is an influential modern American writer known for his past novels Underworld and White Noise, among others. The Silence writes about five people gathering for the Superbowl in 2022 when a catastrophe hits.

Some heavy themes wrapped up in what is otherwise a relatively fluffy novella. The plot's straight-forward, the prose is decent, and it's charming and witty. Murderbot, who repeatedly says that she'd rather be netflixing, is surprisingly relatable. One of my favorite parts is when Murderbot is faced with the prospect of spending time with people and is (understandably) horrified. She can't control her facial reaction which in turn makes the human crew she's assigned to uncomfortable t"

Set in a distant future, a team of scientists are sent to a planet to conduct surface tests,  and they are required to bring along a Company-issued droid. They‚Äôre utterly unaware that this droid has hacked its AI, effectively enabling it to do whatever it wants. ""Whatever it wants"" means that it spends its free time watching cheesy soap operas.  The droid refers to itself as the Murderbot--though it would never say that to the humans it was sent to protect. When danger is afoot, th"

All Systems Red by Martha Wells is A science-fiction novella made for my tastes. The murderbot Diaries is A new series that centers on a robot hacks her own governor thereby making her nearly a person. Murderbot really does not like interacting with people and would rather be on her own. She really doesn't take her job seriously and is quite sarcastic. Bad things have happened and people were killed as a result of her. This is a short adventure, mystery on an unnamed planet.

It was extremely distracting for the author to use apostrophes in place of quotemarks, especially since she had never done this before in other books I have read by her.

I listened to the audio version but I have since learned that the paperback is illustrated so it seems I‚Äôm missing the full experience.

I can easily see how this glimpse fits after His Dark Materials, but I still can't see how Lyra and Pan moved from there to how we see them in the Books of Dust. Anyway, can we have the third Book of Dust already?"
Audrey,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36869814-audrey,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53369413-serpentine,"I requested this from my library instead of buying it, and I'd say that was the right move. It's definitely an interesting story and it was nice to read as I wait for the last book in the Book of Dust trilogy. However, I'm not sure it adds much after The Secret Commonwealth. It does make The Secret Commonwealth even more sad though!"
Stevie,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12798805-stevie,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53369413-serpentine,A nice wee read set between HDM and TBoD. A good gift for fans of the books but don‚Äôt get too excited as it can be read in about 10 mins! Always nice to get more Lyra though. If you haven‚Äôt read the entirety of His Dark Materials though steer well clear of this until you‚Äôre done because massive spoilers abound.
Alistair,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110222105-alistair,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53369413-serpentine,"I really enjoyed reading this story, and as always it fits into the storyline perfectly. My only complaint is that it felt a little bit rushed - the other two short stories felt more like excerpts from a much longer book whereas this felt like a real short story. Maybe I'm just greedy because I can't get enough of these stories and I can't wait for the last in the new trilogy."
Matt,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7820655-matt,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53369413-serpentine,A charming story to bridge the gap between series' about Lyra. There's very little by way of plot progression or revelation about the world here. Just a meditative snapshoy of one afternoon in Lyra's life after the Amber Spyglass concludes. Feels more like post-novel bonus material than a stand-alone publication.

Penric, whose adventures have featured in this novella series since its beginning in Penric‚Äôs Demon, is a fascinating character. Or perhaps that should be characters. And that is part of the fascination.

Because Penric was knocked sideways out of the life he planned to lead by the advent of Desdemona in his life, and there his adventures definitely began.

It was interesting to go back to a time when he isn‚Äôt so self assured and mature in his judgements.

Chronologically, it falls somewhere before Penric‚Äôs Mission. The tale itself follows Penric and his demon Desdemona over one night, as they track down a rogue demon through the streets and canals of Lodi, the city Penric currently resides in.
There are several secondary characters, all as colorful as only Bujold could make them, but of all of them, the most magnetic, almost enchanting, is the city itself. The author constructed her Lodi on the blueprints of Ve"

This story seemed a bit shorter than some of the other Penric tales. Or maybe it was that I didn't want it to end.

The city of Lodi was wonderful, full of interesting sights. And boats. Lots of boats. I suspect it is based on a version of Venice.

Penric ends up chasing down a rogue demon on what should be a holiday. Some things are not quite what they seem.

It isn't really a mystery story, although there is a crime or two. There aren't really any clues.

Also one of my favorite bits is"

Penric is asked to check on a madman, and discovers that he is not mad, but demon ridden. Penric does not have the gifts to rescue him, but he knows how to find someone who does.

This book introduces a couple of excellent new characters, a mystery, a heroine, and a romance. That‚Äôs a lot to put into a novella, but under LMB‚Äôs skilled hand it flows along and carries the reader with it."
David Phipps,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4295838-david-phipps,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55681881-masquerade-in-lodi,This short novella is book 9 of the Penric and Desdemona series. This book is set earlier in Penric's life when he has only been with Desdemona for a few years. Penric is asked to look at a captured madman and all the events of the book trigger from that. A little bit of mystery as is the usual for these books. Overall I liked it though next time I read through the whole series I should not read this in book publication order.

While this is the latest novella in the pernicious and Desdemona series, it actually falls earlier in the series chronologically.

The latest Penric and Desdemona novella is actually set earlier than the last few, but while I was a little disappointed not to see Penric's family, I did like it a lot.

The first book was explosive and I have been eagerly awaiting this second instalment.

The Fires of Vengeance has everything amazing that the first book had. But it also has more! More action, character development, plot thickening, twists and turns and, my absolute favourite, world building.

Winter has an incredible way of connecting the characters with t"

Evan Winter is definitely the new one to watch. I suspected it at the end of Rage of Dragons but now there's no doubt.

It was always going to be hard to be better than Book 1 It was just so different, unique, diverse and engaging. But Winter has knocked it out of the park for this second instalment. It still has all the elements we loved from the first, the great main character (Tau), development through battle, skilled world building and fasted paced action, but in addition to all this"

The mark of a good writer telling an action packed story is if he can keep the reader gripped even as nothing ‚Äúexciting‚Äù happens. Winter, just from reading the first book in this series is obviously a good writer. He doesn‚Äôt let that shine through here, eschewing detail for cumbersome story telling that lacks an arc, and for much of it a point.

Great story continuation from the first book. While everyone is trying to come to terms of lessers being equal to the nobles, the queen won't let her kingdom get torn apart by treachery. Plenty of demons, lots of fast action battles and best of all, dragons! The characterization of the main cast is top notch, all equally important and relatable. What everyone really wants to know about is Tau. The main character that's filled with rage and enough hatred that it's easy to see that ha"

Thanks to both for allowing me to read this second in the series.

I did not think at the start of this book that it could get any better than book 1.- The Rage of Dragons.How wrong was I.Wow.It had me hooked again from the very first page and brought all the feelings back that I had at end of book 1.

Perfectly serviceable... but nothing spectacular either. It at once felt very short and very long, too trim and also bloated. Rage of Dragons was far better because the emotional heart of the story shone through in far greater degrees, and the conflict felt far more visceral. In this installment, Tau is an unstoppable machine, and I never really feared for his life. The other characters are rather flat.

However, I really enjoyed the other POVs"

I love so much about this series so far. Although I fear some of the things I love are going to change in the following books, for one I‚Äôm such a sucker for a vengeance plot device and in order to have some character development I think this will be less prevalent going forward. Secondly I‚Äôm just really not a fan of a romance that‚Äôs being set up in this book, I don‚Äôt feel the necessity or the chemistry in it.

Amazing. The characters in this story grew in such believable and interesting ways. I understood the choices they made, even the choices I didn‚Äôt like, because it was exactly what they should have done.

When reading I kept glancing at the page count because I was so hesitant to finish this book. Few authors can cut to the heart of the action with tense scenes that don't require chapters of setup like Evan Winter. You could feel Tau's anguish in the pages and both battle and character scenes continue to build this amazing world.

This novel seemed to go by very fast. As I said, it‚Äôs entertaining; but, there‚Äôs a lack of character and story development that make it seem superficial. Events move too quickly, as if there‚Äôs a rush to tie up loose story plot to get to the main plot line. It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs taken two novels to get there, that‚Äôs the problem.

Divorced and eager to find herself again, she jumps at the chance to become the caretaker of Ivy House, a place full of fond childhood memories. But the butler, gardener, and next door neighbor seem to be off their rockers. They keep muttering about alphas and being the chosen one. But she has seen her fair"

I‚Äôm giving Magical Midlife Madness 4 ¬Ω stars. KF Breene surprised me with this one. Being a fifty-something that loves to read and write in this genre, a genre that usually showcases young female leads as they discover their destiny, this book was pleasantly unexpected. I could relate to Jessie on so many levels. Yet, I thought that forty was the new thirty? I‚Äôll leave that there for just a minute.

What I loved about this story: snarky humor, Jessie‚Äôs ‚ÄúHa‚Äù moments are hilarious,"

Jessie is a 40yr old recently divorced newly empty nester that has decided to stop fading into the background and find her true self again.

The writing is phenomenal, the characters are intriguing, the story plot in engaging and everything is so exciting that it grabs you and holds you until the end. I love that the author chose to turn this into a series instead of stopping at book 1. It's a classic idea for the paranormal genre with a superb new twist. Well done to the author on another successful book. I can't wait to see what happens next."

Not everyone gets to become a ravishingly beautiful female gargoyle and learn to fly. KF Breene not only hits the fantasy of life after 40, but also the descriptives of Dating internet and otherwise are just so apt, between belly guffaws and heartthrob. This second installment as Jessie learns more about her power and her team, is perfection. At least Jessie got a great car out of it all too!"

It's fast paced, keeping you on the edge of your seat, while developing great characters you will grow to care about. You have a heroine that needs to learn to fly, a group of sidekicks that will keep you laughing, and the hero that doesn't want to be one.
A good read and one of Breene's best works yet. Looking forward to the next in this series."

This takes place in the early 21st century in Chicago, where the Cubs still matter, and a world where murder has become pointless, due to some undefined, supernatural event allowing (only) murder victims, another life... and when they wake-up, they can simply call the police and point out the guilty party!

I also appreciate it when an author can admit the rules they set up don't completely work, and that use that discrepancy as a key to the plot. The line between murder and suicide is a central concept in this world where murdered victims almost always come back, but suicides do not.

I'm glad that I refreshed my memory of the first volume before listening to this. It would probably work okay-ish as a stand-alone, but some of the nuance of the back story and previous interactions between the characters would be missed.

So again, this is Scalzi playing to his strengths. A pacey detective story, heavy on dialogue, with plenty of wisecracking thrown in. Doesn't outstay its welcome.

Do it again. Pl"

The Dispatcher was one of the first Audible releases I read and I really enjoyed it.

The idea of being able to be killed only to appear somewhere else isn't one I've come across before and I like stumbling on something different.

I was glad to see that the author had already written a sequel. Scalzi clearly did some thinking about this world and more of the grey areas that would exist in a world without murder.

Scalzi explores more of the unexpected situations that happen when a society lives in the world like the one he imagines. That's most excellent. Also, I enjoyed the scenarios.

I did not particularly like the reader: Zachary Quinto is a dog actor, I enjoyed his movies but audiobooks are different, he has a nice deep voice but very monotone, he hardly differentiate characters and often does not use pauses and silence for dramatic effect, he flies over sentences and paragraphs that should not be meshed together.

This is a world in which people who are murdered or die by accident don't die; no one knows how or why it works but in 999 cases out of 1000, it does. So to actually murder someone and have it stick, alternative means must be devised. It's well written and smartly presented; it doesn't insult your intelligence. High props!"

This story is more of a detective whodunit. I admire Scalzi's ability to take a ludicrous setup like the revival of the murdered and run with it in a thoroughly logical way turning what would normally look like fantasy and turn it into science fiction. As always his dialogue is fun, alive, and occasionally snarky. Good job."

Why? Too short. Too transparent. And done too death by episodic television. As a follow up to The Dispatcher, I was intrigued though and tried it on a cold football and political ad filled afternoon.

With the worldbuilding behind him, Scalzi can delve into the details of how people behave in the new murderless world and what it means to be a target for unsavory characters. As before, there is no real detective story, but rather things are explained to the main character by another character, but this time the main character takes some action that changes the flow of the story."

I'm giving it a 3/5 based on the fact that it was too short to for real character development and there needed to be far more exploration of the phenomenon the book was based around. The narrator, Zachary Quinto (Slylar on the show Heros) was beyond excellent and I will look for future audiobooks he has done."

This short story was close to perfect. Nothing felt rushed or forced, and you didn't feel shorted at all because of the length, which are two main problems with some of these shorter works.

I mean why do people come back from the dead when murdered? Magic, living in a simulation, it's all a dream. The plot feels like a Twilight Zone episode.

Logan Horsford,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17812869-logan-horsford,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55291869-murder-by-other-means,"In the second (very) short story, this one continues the adventures of Tony from the previous short story.

This one was OK aside from the fact that the 'coincidence fairy' was way too obvious.

If I had stuff like this happen to me, I would begin to wonder if the world itself was a simulation. I get the author wanting to wrap everything up in a bow but geeze."
Robert,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14702250-robert,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55291869-murder-by-other-means,"The second novella in the Dispatcher series, this one is more of a noir-ish mystery. Its premise is an expansion of the world building the first novella. How can the bad guys get rid of a victim when murder is not final? I enjoyed both the writing and the narration by Zachary Quinto. I hope there will be more to come."

The empress of salt and fortune is a short story about an exiled empress and her rise to power and her unconditional love for women.

While the whimsical writing style of this book enhanced the experience, turning the story into a fairy tale, there was little to anything else to this book.

The characters, while complex, were seen from distance, which made any kind of emotional connection impossible. The pacing of the story felt off, as th"

The cadence of this novella has a pure and lyrical quality. Reading it was like watching a traditional Chinese scroll unfold, the painting rich and nuanced.
And yet the story of a princess contracting to a political marriage, and how she rises to power is a far from traditional tale, even as the telling invokes that.
Told from the viewpoint of Rabbit, the handmaiden to the young exiled Empress, gives a distinct voice to the story.

Some quick scattered thoughts on re-reading this classic:

It's strange how generic this story can feel, since so much that's followed in its wake has adapted and used little parts for its own.

Bilbo Baggins has been chosen (quite unexpectedly) to join a company of dwarves and a wizard on a great epic journey to remove a dragon from a mountain filled with gold.
This is indeed a very epic journey. Tolkien writes in such a way that he is speaking directly to you as if he were sitting in front of you telling you that his tale from beginning to end. Throughout the journey he breaks the reality of the book and speaks directly to you through his words. Don't get me wrong this"

I especially liked the tone that this was written in, which felt less formal, and more conversational than The Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit isn't a sprawling epic; it's a good story that was written to make you feel like you're sitting by a fireplace, listening to Grandpa Tolkien tell one of his weird hobbit stories. Yes, you've heard it a million times already, and Grandpa does tend to blather on a little longer than he needs to in certain parts, but overall, you enjoy the experi"

Ironically, they often write the most predictable books of all, as evidenced by Goodkind and Paolini. Though I'm not sure why they protest so much--predictability is hardly a death sentence in genre fantasy.

The archetypal story of a hero, a villain, a profound love, and a world to be saved never seems to get old--it's a great story when it's told well. At the best, it's exciting, exotic, and builds to a"

It took me forever to read, but it is defiantly worth your time.

Of course it is very well written with a lot of description, which was sometimes hard to go through, but it didn‚Äôt ruin the experience. The story itself is layered and complex so you have to be along for the rind to fully enjoy it, because it is a huge series and the first book is just a foundation of greater story, but in this book you can get a good grasp of the story and paint yourself good picture for plot and character"

I watched the tv show and IT'S EVERYTHING. I haven't tried the book again yet, but my hypothesis was right: the story is fabulous, I just have a problem with Martin's writing, and that's stronger than me, I can't really do anything about that. But I love this story and these characters now, so if you have the same problem and can't get through the book, try the tv series. I promise you it's worth it.

I always forget the uncanny power Tolkien's writing has to depress my mood--and the oddest part is, I don't even know why. I'm sure he was a wonderful person, I KNOW he was a great storyteller; but there's something about the way he writes that just plain messes with my mind. It's . . . uncanny, like I said.

Oh, well. All you Tolkienites out there will just have to forgive me."

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, is a fantasy novel written by British author J.K. Rowling, and the second novel in the Harry Potter series.

The plot follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, during which a series of messages on the walls of the school's corridors warn that the ""Chamber of Secrets"" has been opened and that the ""heir of Slytherin"" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical f"

Rowling's ability to make her books an allegory of our modern world and it's big and hideous problems.

I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
Only I will remain.""

My favourite characters are Paul, Thufir Hawat and Stilgar.

Dune has long been a book that has attracted my attention, even before I realised it. When I was seven years old I learned to read with the aid of The Chronicles of Narnia and shortly afterwards The Hobbit. These fantasy novels inspired a love of reading and also a love of wonderful worlds and adventures, a love which was further fostered when at around the same age my parents introduced me to Star Wars.

The fifth installment of the Harry Potter gets a bit darker with the death of a fan favorite and a sadistic new master of the Dark Arts at Hogwarts. Rowling's writing style gets a bit more rounded out and the action is fairly non-stop throughout.

There's a lot to enjoy in JK Rowling's Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix! Some things that stood out for me include the quirky Luna Lovegood (who sees and readily accepts a reality that is different from anyone else in Harry's circle) and 12 Grimmauld Place (the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix that remains invisible to all but the 'secret-keepers' because of a Fidelius Charm).

There's a lot to enjoy in JK Rowling's Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix! Some things that stood out for me include the quirky Luna Lovegood (who sees and readily accepts a reality that is different from anyone else in Harry's circle) and 12 Grimmauld Place (the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix that remains invisible to all but the 'secret-keepers' because of a Fidelius Charm).

You know, I think this book gets a bad rap. Yes Harry is angsty. Yes it's a tad bit whiny. But after having read the whole series, while Goblet was the turning point, Order of the Phoenix was where we saw the universe change and set the course for the rest of the series.

This book is the most crucial one in the entire series of HP. Mostly it deals with the past of Voldemort. Questions like how(s) and why(s) were answered in an amazing way.

I cannot believe this. I love The Hunger Games. I did not see that coming. Which is why I put off reading this series as much as I could. At one point I was sure I would never read it.

But let me start at the beginning. I saw the movie first. It was advertised as Twilight for smart people. I was in my Twilight phase, so I found that offensive as there were no vampires in The Hunger Games. Not to mention the shock and the repulsion at the plot (At that point in my life I had no ide"

The Hunger Games is quite understandably one of the greatest successes in fantasy fiction over the last decade. Although it probably targeted teen fantasy, it is a very entertaining read for any age. The writing is good and pacy, and the characters and their interactions are developed really well not only over this one book but continue over the trilogy. Gradually we get to see the personality traits of Katniss and Peeta, and how they develop as individuals and towards each other. Ka"

and i haven't read any of the harry potter books either, even though i've had many adult friends tell me how great they are.and no other"

That said, it was a good read."

And you've probably already read all of what I have to say before, but I've decided to write this review anyway.

The first person view really allows the reader to connect to Katniss as a character, which I think is really well done. It's great to read that she doesn't always have all the answers, and her flaws make her a much more interesting character. She has just the right amount of emotion, not too soppy and not like a robot."

God, I forgot how much the movies did Peeta Mellark dirty.

This book is phenomenal. How can you possibly describe it as anything else? When it comes to Young Adult literature, the Hunger Games is the gold standard. Which is why a huge part of me didn‚Äôt even want to write a review. I mean, what can I possibly say that hasn‚Äôt been said hundreds of thousands of times?

Rereading this in 2020 was a wild ride. And I think what stuck out the most this time around was just how clueless Katniss is about the fact that she's being set up as the figurehead of a revolution. Even Peeta knows more than she does! It also struck me just how efficient Collins is with her worldbuilding. There's no infodump"

I like a good postapocolyptic type book(once in awhile) and have loved The passage and The Road and therefore I had to try The Hunger games.

I loved the whole idea of The Utopian Nation of Panem, the Capitol controlling the 12 Districts.( I wouldn‚Äôt love it in real life ! only in fiction land)

This book was amazing and I loved every minute of it! I didn't want to put it down and I was so invested I was hooked. I loved this book.

Until then I would have given The Hunger Games a four star rating: well-drawn, sympathetic characters, zippy plot, pathos; and what seemed to be a realistic story/page count proportion.
But then. ""End of Book One."" There was nothing on the book jacket to hip me to the series issue.
I have issues with series. That will have to wait for a non-review rant."

I really enjoyed this book a lot, I had already seen the movies, so I'm not going to pretend that I didn't know what would happen, but anyway, the experience was great, super positive and I ended up devouring this book super fast. I think one of the best things it has is that it's very addictive and after finishing a chapter you want to read the next one immediately. Of course, the plot will always be my favorite factor"

Keely,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84023-j-g-keely,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games,"As I said of Twilight, I already gave the YA bestseller thing a try with Harry Potter and thinking back on it, it wasn't worth the time I put in. Perhaps it was good for me to see one example of what bestsellers look like (bland, poorly-edited, conveniently plotted, cliche), but I see no reason to prove it to myself all over again.

Based on what I've heard from clever folks, Hunger Games blandly avoids its own premise, is about as dystopian as The Giver (which is to say, not at all), and is insid"

This book is abso-freaking-lutely phenomenal. It has been a long time since I've read it, and I don't remember being as engrossed by the story whenever it first came out (when I was in high school maybe?). But this time...man, it has been hard to put it down and walk away. The movies are most fresh in my mind and I can't believe I didn't realize how closely the movie followed the book--from what I could tell, there were only a handful"

One of the best books I have ever read. Katniss would have to be my favourite female character of all time. I could not put this book down. I can't wait to read Catching Fire and Mockingjay! Thankfully I only have to wait 10 days for Mockingjay to be released.

It was a 1 star review; my review itself was pretty childish in hindsight and not particularly constructive or polite, and I considered that perhaps I'd been unfair in regards to this series. Maybe it was its incessant, annoying popularity talking to me more-so than the book itself, or maybe it was just that I'm not big on dystopian novels. I was also a pretty angry, rese"

I‚Äôd just like to say, I have NO IDEA why it took me so long to actually read this book considering within the first two pages I was hooked! I finished this book and thought ‚ÄúSo THIS is what all the fuss is about!‚Äù. Although it took me about 4 days to read, I could have easily read it in one if not for uni assignments (yay).

The premise of The Hunger Games is somewhat disturbing. It‚Äôs a dystopian novel and is set in a not-too-distant fu"
